Momentum or trend-following filters are able to identify times with lower a performance connected with higher volatity or risk. On the other hand, aforementioned can also identify periods with a higher performance with a lower volatility and risk. If this process is succesful, it naturally leads to a strategy that would outperform a passive buy and hold strategy. Same can be said about this strategy and more importantly, it could be seen in the results of the research. Proper timing of each asset class individually leads to an investment that always outperforms the passive buy and hold strategy with much lower drawdowns. Building on that, it is also natural to form a portfolio of several asset classes with incorporated momentum filters that would enhance returns and lower risks as this portfolio exploits diversification benefits of low correlation between assets, allowing to stay invested in asset classes that are suitable at that time and stay away if it is not desired. From the practical point of a view, utilizing the proposed strategy since 1973 (the start of the backtesting period), an investor would have been able to increase risk adjusted returns by diversifying portfolio assets and employing a market-timing solution.  Moreover, the investor would have also been able to avoid many of the tedious bear markets connected with various asset classes. Interestingly, according to the author, avoiding these massive losses would have resulted in equity-like returns with bond-like volatility and drawdown. An interesting thought how to sum it up can be found in the work of Collie, Sylvanus and Thomas: Volatility-responsive asset allocation. ""Market volatility is itself volatile; markets can be relatively stable at some points in time and explosively volatile at others. This means that the risk associated with a traditional (fixed-weight) strategic asset allocation policy can be highly variable over time.""","Partially - Tactical asset allocation strategy like the one proposed by Mebane Faber in his famous paper ""A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation""  usually contains equity like risk assets and TAA strategy tries to rotate out of them during time of stress.

Tactical asset allocation framework can decrease overall risk of equities in a portfolio and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns.","Asset class trend following is a strategy that tries to exploit a momentum anomaly with a proper market-timing, however the perk is that the strategy does it with various assets. The strategy itself is not complicated, yet it is worth mentioning because of its possible usage. Strategy is based on various moving averages/momentum filters to gain an exposure to an asset class only at the time when there is a higher probability for outperformance of the simple buy and hold strategies, but with much lower both volatility and drawdowns. Additionally, author states that the attempt was not to build an optimization model, but rather to build a simple trading model that works in the vast majority of markets, what implicates that this model could and maybe should be modified to suit the investor´s individual needs. To sum it up, the results of the paper suggest that a market timing solution is a risk-reduction technique that signals when an investor should exit a risky asset class in favor of risk-free investments. This strategy has been popularized by Mebane Faber (with risk parity weighting tweaking), but the asset class trend following is widely and positively accepted among the academic world. For example, quoting Hall (A More Quantitative Approach to “A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation): ""His strategy takes advantage of different market regimes. Though his exact strategy may not coincide with the investment goals of financial institutions due to the binary investment decisions in Faber’s strategy, the advantages of investing dependent on the regimes of different asset classes are important enough that institutions should not avoid Tactical Asset Allocation. This paper confirms Faber’s approach that taking advantage of economic cycles can significantly improve risk-adjusted returns.""

Moreover, this anomaily is still receiving a lot of attention from the academic world. As a result, potential investor can find a lot of momentum based strategies, however, it might be worth considering whether the strategy would work in the future. The reason to rotate various asset classes is simple, everything is based on the fact, that various asset classes have different sensibility to business cycles (likewise stocks from different industry sectors also have different sensitivity). Therefore it is possible to rotate between asset classes and hold only asset classes with the highest probability of returns and lowest probability of losses. According to the Kessler and Scherer, and their work ""Macro Momentum and the Economy"",  the success of the rotational strategy can be attributed to predictable variations in the investment opportunity set. Where excess returns can be interpreted as payoffs for rational investors hedging against predictable changes in investment opportunity set. Last but not least, the applicability of this strategy is ensured by the fact that the practitioner today can choose from thousands of mutual funds, ETFs or closed-end funds. Many of these funds can be traded for $8 a trade or less and many mutual funds, and ETFs are now commission free at some online brokers.","Partially - Tactical asset allocation strategy like the one proposed by Mebane Faber in his famous paper ""A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation""  usually contains equity like risk assets and TAA strategy tries to rotate out of them during time of stress.

Tactical asset allocation framework can decrease overall risk of equities in a portfolio and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns.","Momentum based strategies, in which are grouped both trendfollowing and relative strength techniques, have been applied as investment strategies for over a century and no doubt, momentum is one of the most widely discussed and researched investment strategies. There are various ways how to utilize this anomaly for the profit, a simple one is based on using momentum filter separately in each asset class and then combining asset classes into the one portfolio (as it is done in the ""#1 - Asset Class Trend Following"" strategy). However, another way is to use rotational momentum trading system, in search of the best asset class at the time of the investment. There is a simple way how to achieve that, the rotational momentum system compares the performance of all asset classes and picks only the best performing assets from the investment universe into the investor's portfolio. The results showed robust performance across measurement periods as well as over the past eight decades and yet the trading rule is simple, same as the execution: the portfolio is rebalanced every month and portfolio's holdings are rotated so that only the best performing assets are held - there comes the name ""rotational system"". Various assets could be used in this system, to be more precise: equities, bonds, commodities and REITs. We present Mebane Faber's rotational system as a source paper (and his asset choices in it), however, the basic principle is verified by many other academics. For example, Kessler and Scherer in ""Macro Momentum and the Economy"" have found strong evidence for momentum across various asset classes. Their investment strategy that simultaneously looks at relative momentum between currencies, equities, real estate, commodities and equities leads to stable and robust outperformance that survives both transaction costs as well as various stability tests. There are many other variants we would like to recommend to review and those strategies can be found in the ""Related papers"" section.","Use 5 ETFs (SPY - US stocks, EFA - foreign stocks, BND - bonds, VNQ - REITs, GSG - commodities).

Considering the industry momentum, Moskowitz and Grinblatt states that industry momentum investment strategies, which buy stocks from past winning industries and sell stocks from past losing industries, appear highly profitable, even after controlling for size, book-to-market equity, individual stock momentum, the cross-sectional dispersion in mean returns, and potential microstructure influences.Chen, Jiang and Zhu in ""Do Style and Sector Indexes Carry Momentum?"" stated that the existing literature documents that cross-sectional stock returns exhibit price and earnings momentum patterns. However, the implementation of such strategies, is costly due to the large number of stocks involved and some studies show that momentum profits do not survive transaction costs. Later on, they have examined whether sector indexes commonly used in financial industry also have momentum patterns. Results showed that sector indexes exhibit both price momentum and earnings momentum. Most importantly, these momentum strategies are profitable even after adjusting for potential transaction costs.  Another proof of the functionality and the option how to trade the sector momentum is presented in the paper of Andreu, Swinkels and Tjong-A-Tjoe: Can exchange traded funds be used to exploit country and industry momentum? Firstly, they have tried to answer the question whether country and industry momentum effects can really be exploited by investors or are illusionary in nature. Later, they have analyzed the profitability of country and industry momentum strategies using actual price data on Exchange Traded Funds. The findings were clear, over the sample periods that these ETFs were traded, an investor would have been able to exploit country and industry momentum strategies with an economically significant excess return. Adding the aforementioned to the well-known fact that equity sectors have different sensibility to the business cycles and therefore it is possible to rotate between them, with the aim to hold only the sectors with the highest probability of returns and lowest probability of losses, simply makes the profitable and significant strategy.","No - Strategy is invested exclusively in equities.

It is clear that both momentum and rotational trading strategies are simple but profitable. Interestingly their combination fits the aforementioned case. Momentum is one of the most researched and profitable anomalies, while the rotational trading systems in equity sectors/industries are nearly as old as equity markets. In the past, both traders and investors have noticed an interesting behaviour of stocks, if we group stocks according to their sectors (industries), distinct sector groups would have different sensitivity to business cycles. Naturally, investors in the past have always tried to utilize the different sensitivity. No doubt, a simple approach, where the investor picks the best sector for his investment at the time would make a profitable strategy. Sector rotation itself offers a lot of possibilities how to invest, however, it is safe to say that a rotation based on momentum is one of the most successful. The investment universe proposed by the original paper contains 10 industry sectors, where the investor repeatedly picks equity sectors with the highest momentum (with the best past performance) into his portfolio. Simply said, the objective of this strategy is to outperform the simple strategy consisting of buying and holding an equity index. Additionally, an interesting addition to this topic is the work of Moskowitz and Grinblatt ""Do Industries Explain Momentum?"". They have found that the importance of the industry momentum may be even bigger. Their paper documents a strong and prevalent momentum effect in industry components of stock returns which accounts for much of the individual stock momentum anomaly. Quoting the authors: ""Specifically, momentum investment strategies, which buy past winning stocks and sell past losing stocks, are significantly less profitable once we control for industry momentum."" Lastly, there are two options for this strategy, there is a long only strategy (which we have presented) and a long-short version of this strategy, where investors holds the best performing sectors and shorts the market portfolio or the worst performing sectors.","Use 10 sector ETFs.

For example, Acemoglu, Rogoff and Woodford in the Carry Trades and Currency Crashes says: ""A “naive” investment strategy that chases high yields around the world works remarkably well in currency markets. This strategy is typically referred to as the carry trade in foreign exchange, and it has consistently been very profitable over the last 3 decades."" The academic theory says that according to the uncovered interest rate parity, carry trades should not yield a predictable profit because the difference in interest rates between two countries should be equal to the rate at which investors expect the low-interest-rate currency to rise against the high-interest-rate one. High interest rate currency often do not fall enough to offset carry trade yield difference between both currencies, because the inflation is lower than that which was expected in the high-interest-rate country. Additionally, the carry trades often weak the currency that is borrowed and the reason is simple, investors sell the borrowed money by converting it to the other currencies. Capturing those gains is possible by a systematic portfolio rebalancing. Moreover, the carry trade strategy exploits the “forward-rate bias” or the “forward premium puzzle”, the fact, that the forward rate is not an unbiased estimate of future spot. Contrary to classical notions of efficient markets, carry trades have made money over time and proved themselves. Last but not least, from the classical point of a view, investors who employ the carry trade expose themselves to a currency risk and therefore those investors, which are taking this risk are rewarded by the positive returns over time. Additionally, apart from the source paper, Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan in their work: Common Risk Factors in Currency Markets, have identified the slope factor in exchange rates, where the high interest rate currencies load more on this slope factor than low interest rate currencies, finding that by investing in high interest rate currencies and borrowing in low interest rate currencies, US investors load up on global risk, particularly during bad times.","No - FX Carry is strongly correlated to business cycle and therefore is susceptible to drawdown during periods of stress (as equities are too) ...","The end of Bretton Woods and freely floating currencies allowed for systematic investing strategies in the currencies. Those FX strategies are already well-researched and are supported by the academic work and among them, the carry trade strategy is probably the most well-known in a currency market and also probably the most profitable one. In the past decades, the daily volume in the currency market has increased nearly tenfold. FX market is currently dominated by the large and sophisticated investors. However, the idea of the carry trade strategy is really simple, strategy systematically sells low interest rate currencies and buys high interest rates currencies trying to capture the spread between the rates. Moreover, considering a longer time frame, there is a low correlation between the returns of employing the carry strategy and the returns which could be gained from investing in more traditional asset classes such as equities and bonds. That makes a carry strategy a proven and profitable way how to diversify a portfolio. However, investor must pay attention to the carry trade strategy's correlation with global financial and exchange rate stability.","Create an investment universe consisting of several currencies (10-20).

However, in practice, many investors are either not allowed or they are simply unwilling to actually apply leverage, especially the leverage needed for exploiting the volatility effect. This results in the fact, that the opportunity, which is presented by low risk stocks cannot be easily arbitraged away. Secondly, the volatility effect could be the result of an inefficient and decentralized investment approach. The problem of benchmark driven investing is that asset managers have an incentive to tilt towards high beta or high volatility stocks, which is a relatively simple way for every asset manager to generate returns above the average, if he assumes that the CAPM at least partially holds. This results in overpriced high risk stocks, while low risk stocks may become under-priced, this is particularly consistent with the return patterns which were documented in this paper. The volatility effect may be also caused by the behavioral biases among private investors. Private investors will overpay for risky stocks which are perceived to be similar to lottery tickets, because they are in the search for a high returns in as short time as possible. Additionally, Li, Sullivan and García-Feijóo in their paper, The Low-Volatility Anomaly: Market Evidence on Systematic Risk versus Mispricing, have found out that the anomaly returns associated low-volatility stocks can be attributed to market mispricing or to compensation for higher systematic risk. Soe, in The low-volatility effect: A comprehensive look, claims that volatility-effect challenges the traditional equilibrium asset pricing theory that an asset’s expected return is directly proportional to its beta or systematic risk, or, in other words, higher-risk securities should be rewarded with higher expected returns while lower-risk assets receive lower expected returns. The evidence seems to be endless. Moreover, the volatility effect is similar in size compared to classic effects (momentum, size and value) and remains significant after Fama-French adjustments and double sorts. Last but not least, concentrating on long-term, past 3 years volatility implies a much lower portfolio turnover.","Partially - Low volatility stocks (low risk stocks) are usually more safe during turmoil and Low Volatility Effect in a long-short variant (not long-only, but long-short, where investor holds the lowest volatility decile od stocks and shorts the highest volatility decile of stocks) can be used as portfolio hedge against equity risk. However caution should be used as popularity of low volatility investing could move valuation (measured by common valuation ratios like P/E, P/B, P/CF etc.) of low volatility stocks into excessive high (compared to neutral market valuation). This popularity of low volatility factor investing and high valuation of low volatility stocks can be then detrimental to  their performance during market stress.","Efficient markets theory has been challenged by the finding that relatively simple anomalies can be utilized to construct trading strategies, that are found to generate statistically significant higher returns than those of the market portfolio. There is also a second possibility where the Market efficiency is also challenged, if some simple investment strategy generates a comparable return to that of the market, but at a systematically lower level of risk. Well known strategies which challenge efficiency are Momentum, Size and Value, but a large amount of research has been made about volatility effect in stocks. Low risk stocks exhibit significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than the market portfolio, while high risk stocks significantly underperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Authors Clarke, de Silva and Thorley have found that minimum variance portfolios, based on the 1000 largest US stocks over the years 1968-2005, achieve a volatility reduction of about 25%, while delivering comparable or even higher average returns than the benchmark market portfolio. This paper has even found that portfolios which consist of stocks with the lowest historical volatility are associated with Sharpe ratio improvements, that are even larger than those in aforementioned minimum variance portfolios. Baker, Bradley and Wurgler in their work: Benchmarks as Limits to Arbitrage: Understanding the Low Volatility Anomaly, have proved that over the past 41 years, high volatility and high beta stocks have substantially underperformed low volatility and low beta stocks in U.S. markets. Clearly, there is a lot of evidence that volatility effect is an anomaly that works and should be utilized in a investing strategy. Concentrating on long-term volatility, investor can utilize the aforementioned anomaly by creating decile portfolios that are based on a straightforward ranking of stocks on their historical return volatility. Afterwards, the investor would simply long the decile with the stocks with the lowest volatility (moreover, he can short the decile of stocks with the highest volatility).Going long on low risk stocks and short on high risk stocks produce a significant volatility spread. However, a long-short portfolio isn't the only way to exploit this anomaly. A long-only strategy is much easier to implement than a long-short strategy. The investor could simply go long on low volatility stocks and enjoy the higher Sharpe ratio than common equity indices.","The investment universe consists of global large cap stocks (or US large cap stocks). At the end of the each month, the investor constructs equally weighted decile portfolios by ranking the stocks on the past three year volatility of weekly returns.

The annual alpha spread of global low versus high volatility decile portfolios amounts to 12% over the 1986-2006 period. We also observe this volatility effect within the US, European and Japanese markets in isolation. Furthermore, we find that the volatility effect cannot be explained by other well-known effects such as value and size. Our results indicate that equity investors overpay for risky stocks. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include (i) leverage restrictions, (ii) inefficient two-step investment processes, and (iii) behavioral biases of private investors. In order to exploit the volatility effect in practice we argue that investors should include low risk stocks as a separate asset class in the strategic asset allocation phase of their investment process."

Concentrating on the FX momentum, the segmentation of currency market where some participants act quickly on news while others respond more slowly is one reason why trends emerge and can be protracted.

No surprise, the momentum anomaly is present also in the currencies. In the currency market, momentum is a widely observed feature that many exchange rates trend on a multi-year basis. Therefore, a strategy that follows the trend, typically makes positive returns over time. The financial literature about the anomaly is consistent and the academics agree that the momentum anomaly has its place in the FX market, for example, Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling and Schrimpf in the Currency Momentum Strategies, tested the momentum strategy during the period from 1976 to 2010, with an investment universe consisting of more than 40 currencies. They have found a large and significant cross-sectional spread in excess returns of up to 10% p.a. between past winner and past loser currencies, i.e. currencies with high recent returns continue to outperform currencies with low recent returns by a significant margin. Interestingly, Grobys and Heinonen have even found that there is a robust link between the returns of the momentum anomaly implemented in currency markets and global economic risk, measured by the currency return dispersion (RD). They have found that the spread of the zero-cost momentum strategy is significantly larger in high RD states (worldwide crisis state) compared to low RD states.","Create an investment universe consisting of several currencies (10-20).

This suggests that currency value mostly captures risk premia which vary across countries, but are fairly static over time. Moreover, their results do not support the standard notion that trading on simple measures of currency value is profitable because spot exchange rates are reverting back to fundamental values. When the real exchange rates are decomposed into underlying macroeconomic drivers, it was found that refined valuation measures relate more closely to ""currency value"" in the original sense in that they predict both excess returns as well as a reversal of exchange rates.

The aforementioned concept was founded on the law of one price - the idea that in absence of transaction costs, identical goods in different markets would be priced the same. No surprise, different countries consume different baskets of goods, however, it is partially possible to asses a relative price level, more precisely, it is possible to find out which country is ""cheaper"" and on the other hand, which country is ""more expensive"" for living.

He claims, that ""Human beings don't like to trade against human nature, which wants to buy stocks after they go up not down."" This means that pairs traders are the disciplined investors taking advantage of the undisciplined over-reaction displayed by individual investors. The profits could be also explained by some logical assumptions that result in the high expected probability of future returns of the Pairs Trading portfolio. If prices of some stock pair in past were closely cointegrated, there is a high probability that those two securities share common sources of fundamental return correlations. However, a temporary shock could move one stock out of the common price band which presents a statistical arbitrage opportunity. Additionally, the universe of pairs is continuously updated and this ensures that pairs which no longer move in synchronicity are removed from trading. Therefore, the portfolio includes only pairs with high probability that their prices would be convergent. Moreover, the authors ruled out several explanations for the pairs trading profits, including mean-reversion as previously documented in the literature, unrealized bankruptcy risk, and the inability of arbitrageurs to take advantage of the profits due to short-sale constraints. Chen, Chen and Li in the ""Empirical Investigation of an Equity Pairs Trading Strategy"" have examined the economic drivers of this strategy. First, they have found that this return is not driven purely by the short-term reversal of returns. Secondly, they have decomposed the pair-wise stock return correlations into those that can be explained by common factors (such as size, book-to-market, and accruals) and those that cannot. Quoting the authors: ""We find that the pairs correlations explainable by common factors drive most of the pairs trading returns. Third, the value-weighted profits of pairs trading are higher in firms in a richer information environment, and our trading strategy performs poorly in the recent liquidity crisis, suggesting that the pairs trading profits are not primarily driven by the delay in information diffusion and liquidity provision. Finally, consistent with the adaptive market efficiency theory, the return to this simple pairs trading strategy has diminished over time."" The last only underlines the need for the enhanced Pair Trading strategy - for example the work of Do and Faff.","Yes - Pairs trading strategy is related to other reversal strategies in equity market (see #13 - Short Term Reversal in Stocks) - it is also a type of ""liquidity providing"" strategy and as such it usually performs well during market crises. We recommend a research paper written by Bowen, Hutchinson: ""Pairs Trading in the UK Equity Market: Risk and Return"" for more insights into strategy. Bowen and Hutchinson test pairs trading strategy during two most extreme crises (October 1987 and Autumn 2008) and show that the strategy delivered significantly positive returns. Again these results imply that the strategy benefits from increased volatility or a drop in liquidity.","The practice often shows that profitable trading strategies do not have to be complicated, a good example is a well known Pairs Trading with Stocks. The Pairs Trading is a popular short-term speculation strategy with a long history on Wall Street. However, as it was previously mentioned, the concept of pairs trading is really simple. A potential investor has to find two stocks whose prices have moved together historically. Nextly, when the spread between them widens, short the winner and buy the loser. The profits lie in assumption that the history would repeat. If history repeats itself, prices will converge and the arbitrageur will profit. To sum it up, this strategy is based solely on simple contrarian principles and past stock prices. Simply said, the strategy bets on convergence when the spread between stocks widens.Additionally, same pattern was found in the european markets. Lucey and Walshe in the ""European Equity Pairs Trading: The Effect of Data Frequency on Risk and Return"" examined an equity pairs trading strategy using daily, weekly and monthly European share price data over the period 1998-2007. The authors shows that when stocks are matched into pairs with minimum distance between normalised historical prices, a simple trading rule based on volatility between these prices yields annualised raw returns of up to 15% for the weekly data frequency. On a less positive note, more recent reasearch states that the positive returns of this strategy are slowly diminishing. For example, Chen, Chen and Li in the ""Empirical Investigation of an Equity Pairs Trading Strategy"", have also showed while using past data that an equity pairs trading strategy generates large and significant abnormal returns. However, at the end they said that consistent with the adaptive market efficiency theory, the return to this simple pairs trading strategy has diminished over time. Eroding profits have led academics to improve the strategy.  As example, we would like to mention the paper ""Does simple pairs trading still work?"" written by Do and Faff (the paper can be found in the ""Other Papers"" section).","Illiquid stocks are removed from the investment universe. Cumulative total return index is then created for each stock (dividends included) and starting price during formation period is set to $1 (price normalization). Pairs are formed over a twelve-month period (formation period) and are then traded in next six-month period (trading period). The matching partner for each stock is found by looking for the security that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between two normalized price series. Top 20 pairs with the smallest historical distance measure are then traded and long-short position is opened when pair prices have diverged by two standard deviations and the position is closed when prices revert back.","Gatev, Goetzmann, Rouwenhorst: Pairs Trading: Performance of a Relative Value Arbitrage Rule http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=141615Abstract:      We test a Wall Street investment strategy, pairs trading, with daily data over 1962-2002. Stocks are matched into pairs with minimum distance between normalized historical prices. A simple trading rule yields average annualized excess returns of up to 11 percent for selffinancing portfolios of pairs. The profits typically exceed conservative transaction costs estimates. Bootstrap results suggest that the pairs effect differs from previously-documented reversal profits. Robustness of the excess returns indicates that pairs trading profits from temporary mis-pricing of close substitutes. We link the profitability to the presence of a common factor in the returns, different from conventional risk measures."

The work of Stefan Nagel in the paper Evaporating Liquidity claims that returns of short-term reversal strategies in equity markets can be interpreted as a proxy for the returns from liquidity provision and shows that reversal anomaly returns closely track the returns earned by liquidity providers. Overall, there is a mutual consent that theoretically, reversal strategy does work, however, there is a problem with the transaction costs, that make the strategy inapplicable. This paper and also the work of de Groot, Wilma and Huij, Joop and Zhou, Weili: Another Look at Trading Costs and Short-Term Reversal Profits proved that the strategy works if the investor focus purely on the larger stocks, what reduces the transaction costs. Moreover, research of this paper has used the Nomura cost estimates instead of the trading cost estimates resulting from the Keim and Madhavan model, because trading costs of the model are substantially lower than the Nomura cost estimates and the trading costs of Keim and Madhavan model can even be negative in many cases. Therefore, the results from the Keim and Madhavan model should be interpreted with caution and probably should not even be used. Moreover, additional attractive feature of the trading cost model which was obtained from the Nomura Securities is that it has also been calibrated using European trade data, which eases the European stocks analysis. Lastly, the study has found that net reversal profits are large and positive among large cap stocks over the most recent decade in the sample, which is characterized by the dramatically increased market liquidity. This rules out the explanation that reversals are induced by inventory imbalances by market makers and that the contrarian profits are a compensation for bearing inventory risks.","Yes - Equity reversal strategies are usually type of ""liquidity providing"" strategies and as such they usually perform well during market crises. However, reversal strategies are also naturally a ""short volatility"" strategies, their returns increase mainly in the weeks following large stock market market declines. Traders must be catious during crisis during days with a high volatility as reversal strategies usually force traders to buy stocks which performed especially bad (and to sell short stocks with an extremelly positive short term performance). This position is emotionally hard to open and risk management of reversal strategies must be also very strict during these days. We recommend reading research paper by Nagel: ""Evaporating Liquidity"" to gain insight into behaviour of reversal strategies during crises.","The short-term reversal anomaly, the phenomenon that stocks with relatively low returns over the past month or week earn positive abnormal returns in the following month, or week, and stocks with high returns  earn negative abnormal returns, is well-researched, where a lot of research has been made about this particular anomaly. However,  the researchers hypothesize that reversal strategies require frequent trading and rebalancing in disproportionately high-cost securities, and this would lead to a situation, where trading costs prevent profitable strategy execution. The results might be interpreted in a way that the abnormal returns of reversal investment strategies, which were documented in studies create an illusion of profitable investment strategies, but due to the transaction costs, the strategies are not applicable and the profitable strategies simply do not exist. However, research has found that the impact of trading costs on reversal profits can largely be attributed to an excessively trading in small cap stocks and therefore there exists a solution how to make a reversal strategy profitable, even when the transaction costs are included, but the potential investor must modify the basic strategy. Simply said, the turnover of standard reversal strategies is excessively high. The solution of this problem is simple, the strategy have to be traded on stocks with a larger market capitalization. Aforementioned leads to a profitable and both economically, and statistically significant strategy, which sells past winners, and buys past losers, but is slightly modified in terms of the size of the stocks. Moreover, the paper also made a research about European stocks and found that if the investor invests in to the stocks with larger market capitalization, the reversal strategy would work. Last but not least, the ability of the reversal anomaly to survive trading costs was also studied in the paper Frazzini, Israel and Moskowitz: Trading Costs of Asset Pricing Anomalies.","The investment universe consists of the 100 biggest companies by market capitalization. The investor goes long on the 10 stocks with the lowest performance in the previous month and goes short on the 10 stocks with the greatest performance from the previous month.

We show that the impact of transaction costs on the strategies’ profitability can largely be attributed to excessively trading in small cap stocks. Limiting the stock universe to large cap stocks significantly reduces trading costs. Applying a more sophisticated portfolio construction algorithm to lower turnover reduces trading costs even further. Our finding that reversal strategies can generate 30 to 50 basis points per week net of transaction costs poses a serious challenge to standard rational asset pricing models. Our findings also have important implications for the understanding and practical implementation of reversal strategies."

The most common explanations and probably the main reasons for persistence of the momentum anomaly are behavioral biases like investor herding, investor over and underreaction and lastly, the confirmation bias. For example, if a firm releases good news and the stock price reacts only partially to the good news, then buying the stock after the initial release of the news will generate profits. Rachwalski and Wen in the ""Momentum, Risk and Underreaction"" states that momentum profits can be explained by exposure to risks omitted from common factor models and underreaction to innovations in these omitted risks. Consistent with risk as a partial explanation of momentum profits, long formation period momentum strategies earn higher returns and are more highly correlated with factors designed to measure risk than short formation period momentum strategies. Interestingly, the momentum appers to be quite tax-effective, as it was found in the work of Israel and Moskowitz: ""How Tax Efficient are Equity Styles?"". Quoting the authors: ""On an after-tax basis, value and momentum portfolios outperform, and growth underperforms, the market. We find that momentum, despite its higher turnover, is often more tax efficient than value, because it generates substantial short-term losses and lower dividend income. Tax optimization improves the returns to all equity styles, with the biggest improvements accruing to value and momentum styles. However, only momentum allows significant tax minimization without incurring significant style drift.""","No - Pure long only equity momementum strategy implicitly can't be used as a hedge. Long-short equity momentum factor is also a troublesome for hedging as a momentum factor is prone to ""momentum crashes"". Equity momentum factor performs well during first stages of crises (as it usually shorts stocks with astrong downward momemtum and buys stocks which are not falling fast). Momentum crashes usually occurred right as the market rebounded following large previous declines. One explanation for this pattern is the time-varying systematic risk of the momentum strategy because momentum has significant negative beta following bear markets. Numerous amended versions of basic momentum strategy appeared after 2008 bear market. These adjusted strategies may offer better hedge against equity market risk.","Nowadays, the momentum strategies are well-known and generally accepted in both public and academic world. Yet, the momentum strategy is based on a simple idea, the theory about momentum states that stocks which have performed well in the past, would continue to perform well and on the other hand, stocks which have performed bad in the past, would continue to perform badly. This results in profitable but simple strategy of buying past winners and selling past losers. Moreover, the strategy selects stocks on the basis of returns over the past J months and holds them for K months, the selection of J and K is purely dependent from the choice of the investor but we are presenting results of 12-1 month momentum strategy. To sum it up, the stocks which have outperformed peers during the K months period tends to perform good in the upcoming period and vice versa. Additionally, the momentum strategies are also profitable outside the United States. Academic research proved that this effect works in stock markets in other developed countries and also in emerging markets. Moreover, momentum effect works in a small cap universe as well as in a large cap universe and it is safe to say that momentum is one of the most academically investigated effects with a strong persistence. Pure momentum portfolios are created in a way that investor longs stocks with the strongest momentum and shorts stocks with the lowest momentum. However, this pure momentum portfolio recorded a disastrous year 2009 with more than 80% drawdown (data from Kenneth French library - http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Momentum_Factor.zip). Despite the crash, the momentum factor is still a strong performance contributor in long only portfolios (long stocks with the strongest momentum without shorting the market or low momentum stocks). This supports for example, Griffin, Ji and Martin in the ""Global Momentum Strategies: A Portfolio Perspective"". The authors have found that momentum is generally more profitable on the long side than on the short side, making it accessible to a broad range of institutional capital. Additionally, both price and earnings momentum profits are significant globally. Interesting point of a view on this topic have Barroso and Santa-Clara in their work ""Managing the Risk of Momentum"". Quoting the authors: ""Compared to the market, value or size risk factors, momentum has offered investors the highest Sharpe ratio. However, momentum has also had the worst crashes, making the strategy unappealing to investors with reasonable risk aversion. We find that the risk of momentum is highly variable over time and quite predictable. The major source of predictability does not come from systematic risk but from specific risk. Managing this time-varying risk virtually eliminates crashes and nearly doubles the Sharpe ratio of the momentum strategy.""","This investment strategy depends on investor needs as it is possible to create momentum portfolio consisting of 20 stocks or several hundreds of stocks. We present a complex strategy which is the underlying strategy for benchmarks calculated in Keneth French data library (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). Our investment universe consists of the largest 20% of stocks on NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX. 20% of stocks with the best 12 month momentum (12 month performance) are then added to our portfolio and are weighted equally and the portfolio is rebalanced once in a month. Our benchmark is an equally weighted portfolio of the largest 20% of stocks on NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX.","Jagadeesh, Titman: Momentum http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=299107Abstract:      There is substantial evidence that indicates that stocks that perform the best (worst) over a three- to 12-month period tend to continue to perform well (poorly) over the subsequent three to 12 months. Momentum trading strategies that exploit this phenomenon have been consistently profitable in the United States and in most developed markets. Similarly, stocks with high earnings momentum outperform stocks with low earnings momentum.

The past research shows strong support for the momentum effects. The theory says that the main reasons for the persistence of the anomaly are behavioral biases like investor herding, investor over and underreaction and confirmation bias. Moreover, the additional evidence could be provided for example by the Bhorjaj and Swaminathan in the ""Macromomentum: Evidence of Predictability in International Equity Markets"". They have examined momentum and reversals in portfolios of international stock indices and the results indicate strong momentum up to a year following the portfolio formation date. They hypothesize that these patterns seem to be related to misreaction to news about macroeconomic conditions, not corporate earnings. Overall, their results demonstrate the pervasiveness of momentum and reversals and provide support for behavioral theories. Even more related research is that of the Andreu, Swinkels and Tjong-A-Tjoe: ""Can exchange traded funds be used to exploit country and industry momentum?"". According to those authours, there is overwhelming empirical evidence on the existence of country and industry momentum effects. This line of research suggests that investors who buy countries and industries with relatively high past returns and sell countries and industries with relatively low past returns will earn positive risk-adjusted returns. However, as they stress out, these studies focus on country and industry indexes that cannot be traded directly by investors. Therefore, they have analyzed the profitability of country and industry momentum strategies using actual price data on Exchange Traded Funds. Over the sample periods that these ETFs were traded, an investor would have been able to exploit country and industry momentum strategies with an excess return of about 5% per annum. The daily average bid-ask spreads on ETFs are substantially below the implied break-even transaction costs levels. Hence, they have concluded that investors that are not willing or able to trade individual stocks are able to use ETFs to benefit from momentum effects in country and industry portfolios.","No - Momentum in country equity indexes is a long only strategy and as such has a strong exposition to equity market risk. Tendency of momentum to pick strongly performing but often small and emerging countries into portflio during late stage of business cycle (when these countries usually overperform) also doesn't help - country momentum has higher equity beta during this time and falls faster then benchmark portfolio.","No doubt, the momentum anomaly is one the most well-known in the finance world. Moreover, this anomaly is well-researched and considered as one of the strongest anomaly. Basically, the momentum is a trendfollowing strategy, where the strategy buys the assets which has performed well in the past and sells the assets which has performed bad. Although, the anomaly was originally discovered for stocks in just one country, since that time, the momentum has received a lot of academic interest. This has resulted in many momentum modifications and additionally, more and more academic studies show that this anomaly is working also on country equity indexes. The availability Exchange traded funds (or shortened ETFs) on stock market indices provides an attractive vehicle for investors seeking low-cost, geographically diversified assets. The MSCI World Index comprises 70 country indices, on a market capitalisation weighted basis, with no over-lapping shares. Additionally, historical total return data for the individual underlying country indices is available from their database in both local currencies and US dollars. The ETFs makes it possible to examine the returns that without the ETFs, could have been achieved only by purchasing a well diversified, equal weighted portfolio of country indices as a benchmark to investigate momentum effects on portfolios of country indices. Such strategy which combines the ETFs for equity indices and the momentum is attractive because trading strategies on single shares have been shown to be ‘traded-out’ as increasing numbers of fund managers mimic the strategy. Country indices, on account of their significantly larger underlying market capitalisations, are likely to show more persistent momentum. The profitable and significant strategy would simply find the ""winners"" among the country indices and long them.","The investment universe consists of ETFs (funds) which invest in individual countries equity indexes. The top 5 countries with the best X - month (where X depends on investors choice, studies shows X to be best as 10-12) momentum are chosen as investment and portfolio is rebalanced once in a month.","Muller, Ward: Momentum effects in country equity indexes http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/14149/Muller_Momentum%282010%29.pdf?sequence=1Abstract:      This paper examines the 70 country indices which comprise the MSCI world index as a representative set of global equity investment opportunities, and examines momentum and mean reversion effects in these. We show that persistent and significant effects do exist, particularly with regard to short-term momentum. A strategy of holding for one month, a portfolio of the four best performing MSCI country indices over the previous 11 months, was found to persistently out-perform an equal weighted benchmark by around 10% per annum over the 39 year period from 1970 to 2009."

However, there are some factors that make it impossible to surely identify the real explanation. The short data sample, the relatively small number of countries, the possibility of imperfect integration of markets and the lack of a generally accepted asset pricing model combined, make it difficult to distinguish between these possible interpretations. Although, the absence of an explanation for the winner-loser reversals in national market indices is not surprising given that researchers still differ in their assessment of the causes of price-based anomalies in the U.S. market. Firstly, the major result of the paper is the absence of any support for the hypothesis that the reversals reflect risk differentials. No evidence suggest that returns during backtesting period of prior losers were significantly riskier than those of prior winners, while looking both on their standard deviations and their correlations with the world market return or other known risk factors. Anyway, there is evidence that winner-loser reversals are larger among the smaller markets than the larger markets, so there may be an element of a ""small-country effect"" or simply related to some form of market imperfection. Secondly, a possible interpretation of the results might be that reversals are the result of cross-border equity flows being insufficiently large to remove mispricing, perhaps due to investors' fears of expropriation or capital controls. Preliminary evidence for this view might be found in the observation that the contrarian strategy would have yielded below-average returns near the end of the sample period, however as it was previously mentioned, even some more recent papers identify this anomaly. Another possible interpretation could be that it may not even be realistic to expect from arbitrage to remove all price discrepancies given the uncertainty in the valuation of equities, the high volatility of returns and the apparently long time required for mispricing to be removed. Last but not least, it is possible that increases in cross-border flows may actually add to the degree of mispricing because it implies that there will be more momentum investors with aim to ""jump on the bandwagon"" of the moment.","No - Mean reversion in country equity indexes is again a long only strategy and as such has a strong exposition to equity market risk. Long-term mean reversion factor usually works best after crises but is not a good candidate for hedging equity risk during crises.","DeBondt and Thaler in 1985 have found the presence of the winner-loser reversals in the U.S. stock market. The idea is simple, stocks that have been ""losers"" in a given ranking period are likely to yield subsequently higher returns than the corresponding ""winner"" stocks. Since the first study, the winer-loser reversals in the U.S. stocks have been largely studied by the academics and the idea was slightly modified in search of even better performance. Moreover, the winner-loser reversals were also found by the Richards (1995) in national stock market indices. This paper extends his research and explores it even more, while using data for the return indices of 16 national markets. The finding of the paper, that reversals are strongest around the 3-year horizon during the testing period results in a simply manageable strategy. The results are similar to those of Balvers, Wu and Gilliland in the ""Stock Markets and Parametric Contrarian Investment Strategies"". They have found a strong evidence of mean reversion in relative stock index prices. Their findings imply a significantly positive speed of reversion with a halflife of three to three and one-half years (similar to results of this paper). Additionally, their result is robust to alternative specifications and data. The results could be also linked with the work of Spierdijk, Bikker and Van den Hoek - ""Mean Reversion in International Stock Markets: An Empirical Analysis of the 20th Century"", this paper analyzes mean reversion in international stock markets during the period 1900-2008, using annual data and stock indexes in seventeen developed countries, covering a time span of more than a century. They have documented, the half-lives ranging from a minimum of 2.1 years to a maximum of 23.8 years. Their results also suggest that the speed at which stocks revert to their fundamental value is higher in periods of high economic uncertainty, caused by major economic and political events. Additionaly, although the reversion in stock indices is present and profitable, we can say the same about momentum. Balvers and Wu in the ""Momentum and mean reversion across national equity markets"" explored this effects jointly. Quoting the authors: ""Combination momentum-contrarian strategies, used to select from among 18 developed equity markets at a monthly frequency, outperform both pure momentum and pure contrarian strategies"".","The investment universe consists of 16 ETFs (funds) which invest in individual countries equity indexes.

There is no evidence that loser countries are riskier than winner countries either in terms of standard deviations, covariance with the world market or other risk factors, or performance in adverse economic states of the world. While there is evidence that small markets are subject to larger reversals than large markets, perhaps because of some form of market imperfection, the reversals are not just a small-market phenomenon. The apparent anomaly of winner-loser reversals in national market indices therefore remains unresolved."

Research therefore suggests the possibility to earn a systematic risk premium by selling at-the-money options short-term. Numerous papers show that this premium is quite substantial - selling put options gives average returns ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% per day. However, strong caution is needed in implementing these short volatility strategies (strategies which exploit the volatility premium by selling volatility - usually selling put options or straddles) as the return distribution is very abnormal (put sellers historically could incur losses up to -800%). There is also a strong serial correlation in large negative days (from the put seller's point of view); therefore, substantial margin reserves are needed when implementing these strategies and returns are then much lower. We present a simple option strategy exploiting the option premium, with a backtested period which includes the 1987 crash.","Each month, at-the-money straddle, with one month until maturity, is sold at the bid price with a 5% option premium, and an offsetting 15% out-of-the-money puts are bought (at the ask price) as insurance against a market crash.

Under mild assumptions, call options have expected returns which exceed those of their underlying security and which are increasing in their strike prices. Likewise, put options have expected returns which are below the risk-free rate and which are also increasing in their strike prices. Across a variety of time periods and return frequencies, S&P 500 and 100 index option returns strongly exhibit these characteristics. Under stronger assumptions, expected option returns are a linear function of option betas. Fama-MacBeth-style option return regressions produce risk premia close to the expected market return. However, the regression intercepts are significantly below zero. As a result, zero-beta, at-the-money straddle positions produce average losses of approximately three percent per week. Zero-beta straddles in other markets also lose money consistently. These findings suggest that some additional factor, such as systematic stochastic volatility, is priced in option returns."

The results of the paper suggest that the momentum strategies buy backwardated contracts and sell contangoed contracts. This implicitly suggests that a momentum strategy that consistently trades the most backwardated and contangoed contracts is likely to be profitable. The aforementioned leads to a thought that the momentum profits in commodity futures markets are linked to an economic rationale related to Keynes (1930) and Hicks (1939) theory of normal backwardation. On the other hand, it was denied that the momentum profits are a compensation for risk (whether it is constant or time-dependent). Interestingly, the momentum returns are also found to have low correlations with the returns of traditional asset classes, making the commodity-based relative-strength strategies good candidates for inclusion in well-diversified portfolios. Switzer and Jiang in the ""Market Efficiency and the Risks and Returns of Dynamic Trading Strategies with Commodity Futures"" states that the existence of profits from active trading strategies based on momentum is consistent with behavioral finance and behavioral psychology models in which market participants irrationally underreact to information and trends. Moreover, profits from active strategies based on winner and loser portfolios are partly conditioned on term structure and net hedging pressure effects. Last but not least, the functionality also stems from the perks we have previously mentioned - liquidity, only 31 commodities and low transaction costs all help to make this strategy profitable.","Yes - Commodity momentum strategy is a cornerstone of a trend-following CTA funds and as such is an excelent candidate for an uncorrelated strategy and very often a hedge to equity market factor. We recommend for example Blitz, De Groot - ""Strategic Allocation to Commodity Factor Premiums"" for more information regarding using commodity factor porftolios in asset allocation.","According to the researches of Bodie and Rosansky, commodity futures are excellent portfolio diversifiers and some of them are even an effective hedge against inflation. Although the short-term price continuation was identified in equity markets by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001), the theory still holds true if we consider a different asset class - commodities. In the world of commodities, the momentum strategies buy the commodity futures that outperformed in the recent past and sell the commodity futures that under-performed, and hold the relative-strength portfolios for up to 12 months. Additionally, it was proved that investors can use various combinations of ranking periods and holding periods and these strategies would still be profitable. Moreover, there are some strong rationales for implementing momentum strategies in commodity futures markets. Firstly, commodity-based long-short strategies minimize transaction costs. Nextly, the commodity momentum strategies trade liquid contracts with nearby maturities and commodities do not have any troubles with the short-selling restrictions that are often imposed in equity markets. Adding the fact, that this strategy only focuses on 31 commodity futures (as opposed to hundreds or thousands of stocks), it is very unlikely that the abnormal returns identified by the paper would be eroded by the costs of implementing the momentum strategy or will be a compensation for a lack of liquidity. Adding even more to the set of perks, momentum returns are also found to have low correlations with the returns of traditional asset classes, making the commodity-based relative-strength strategies good candidates for inclusion in well-diversified portfolios.  Simillar results can be found also in other papers, for example Switzer and Jiang in the ""Market Efficiency and the Risks and Returns of Dynamic Trading Strategies with Commodity Futures"", have found that significant momentum profits are identified in both outright futures and spread trading strategies when the spot premium and the term premium are used to form winner and loser portfolios. A good point is also in the work of Blitz and De Groot:  ""Strategic Allocation to Commodity Factor Premiums"". The authors have confirmed the existence of sizable momentum, carry and low-volatility factor premiums in the commodity market and argue that investors should consider these commodity factor premiums when determining their strategic asset allocation. They have also found that diversified portfolios of commodity factor premiums exhibits a significantly better risk-adjusted performance than the commodity market portfolio and adds significant value to a conventional stock/bond portfolio.","Create a universe of tradable commodity futures. Rank futures performance for each commodity for the last 12 months and divide them into quintiles. Go long on the quintile with highest momentum and go short on the quintile with lowest momentum.

While contrarian strategies do not work, the article identifies 13 profitable momentum strategies that generate 9.38% average return a year. A closer analysis of the commodity futures that the momentum strategy recommends trading reveals that we buy backwardated contracts and sell contangoed contracts with high volatilities. The correlation between the momentum returns and the returns of traditional asset classes is also found to be low, making the commoditybased relative-strength portfolios excellent candidates for inclusion in well-diversified portfolios."

Producers or consumers of the underlying commodity transfer the risk of price fluctuations to speculators, who are willing to undertake this risk in the hope of a large positive return. If the supply by short hedgers exceeds the demand by long hedgers (namely, hedgers are net short), the futures price today has to be a downward-biased estimate of the futures price at maturity. Moreover, from the practical point of a view, term-structure strategies are connected with various interesting properties for the potential investors. To be more precise, term-structure strategies comes with lower maximum drawdowns, higher maximum run-ups and both lower minimum, and higher maximum 12-month rolling returns than the benchmark. Additionally, the reward-to-risk and Sortino ratios of all 7 profitable active term-structure strategies in the paper, exceed those of the passive strategy or the benchmark. Hence, the high average returns of the term structure strategies appear to more than compensate investors for the increase in volatility and downside risk that they bear relative to the passive benchmark. Interestingly, the returns of the long-short portfolios follow the ups and downs of the S&P GSCI but are unrelated to the S&P500, what offers a way for the diversification of equity portfolios. Erb and Harvey in ""The Tactical and Strategic Value of Commodity Futures"" state that historically, the average annualized excess return of individual commodity futures has been approximately zero and commodity futures returns have been largely uncorrelated with one another. However, the prospective annualized excess return of a rebalanced portfolio of commodity futures can be equity-like. Certain security characteristics, such as the term structure of futures prices, and some portfolio strategies have historically been rewarded with above average returns. An interesting view on this topic can be found also in the work of Durr and Voegeli: Structural Properties of Commodity Futures Term Structures and Their Implications for Basic Trading Strategies. Time series of commodity prices and returns were analyzed by means of static and rolling principal component analysis. The authors have found high stability of the principal components and their explanatory power over time. The first component identified as a level factor is paramount for the interpretation of term structure dynamics for most underlyings. This result suggests that an investor can exploit the information contained within the term structure and revealed by principal component analysis.","No - Term Structure (or Carry) in commodities is not so good hedge/diversifier as a momentum factor. Bakshi, Bahshi and Rossi research paper ""Understanding the Sources of Risk Underlying the Cross-Section of Commodity Returns"" analyzes exposure of various commodity factor strategies and shows that the commodity carry factor is linked to innovations in global equity return volatility. In periods where global equity volatility increases (decreases), the carry factor delivers low (high) returns. Additionally, innovations in global equity volatility can price the commodity portfolios sorted on carry. At the same time, we show that innovations in global equity volatility cannot price commodity portfolios sorted on momentum. The economic intuition is that the high average returns to carry is compensation for the low payoff of the strategy when volatility increases.","Commodity futures have become widespreaded vehicles among various investors and traders. Both past research and practice have shown that commodities can be used for strategic and tactical asset allocations. The strategic appeal of commodity indices comes from their equity-like return, their inflation-hedging properties and their role for risk diversification. Keynes (1930) and Cootner (1960) put forward the idea that commodity futures prices depend on the net positions of hedgers. This can be simply viewed as a form of insurance. Producers and consumers of the underlying commodity transfer the risk of price fluctuations to speculators. Naturally, speculators are willing to undertake this risk in the hope of a large positive return. The term structure of commodity futures can have two forms. Firstly, the increase in the futures price as maturity approaches is referred to as normal backwardation and secondly, the decrease in the futures price as maturity approaches is traditionally referred to as contango. Both normal backwardation and contango arise as a result of the inequality between the long and short positions of hedgers, which require the intervention of speculators to restore equilibrium. Therefore commodity futures returns are directly related to the propensity of hedgers to be net long or net short. Aforementioned, leads to a simple design of an active strategy that buys mostly backwardated contracts and shorts mostly contangoed contracts - the strategy which exploits the term structure in commodities.Last but not least, simillar results can be found in the paper of Shwayder and James: ""Returns to the Commodity Carry Trade"". In their speculation strategy, an investor buys commodity futures if the underlying commodity market is in backwardation and sells commodity futures if the underlying commodity market is in contango. Moreover, they have demonstrated that this strategy, if applied to a portfolio of 28 commodities, is characterized by high returns and high Sharpe ratios which are uncorrelated with conventional risk factors.","This simple strategy buys each month the 20% of commodities with the highest roll-returns and shorts the 20% of commodities with the lowest roll-returns and holds the long-short positions for one month. The contracts in each quintile are equally-weighted. The investment universe is all commodity futures contracts.","Fuertes, Miffre, Rallis: Tactical Allocation in Commodity Futures Markets: Combining Momentum and Term Structure Signalshttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1127213Abstract:      This paper examines the combined role of momentum and term structure signals for the design of profitable trading strategies in commodity futures markets. With significant annualized alphas of 10.14% and 12.66% respectively, the momentum and term structure strategies appear profitable when implemented individually. With an abnormal return of 21.02%, a novel double-sort strategy that exploits both momentum and term structure signals clearly outperforms the single-sort strategies. This double-sort strategy can additionally be utilized as a portfolio diversification tool. Interestingly, the abnormal performance of the double-sort portfolios cannot be explained by a lack of liquidity or data mining and is robust to transaction costs and to different specifications of the risk-return trade-off."

Firstly, according to the Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) or Garret, Kamstra and Kramer (2004) the seasonal pattern can be attributed to a time varying equity premium influenced by the Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) effect, the so-called winter depression. The link may be there because of evidence taken from psychological literature shows that depression lowers one’s willingness to take risk. Kamstra, Kramer and Levi state that: ""SAD is an extensively documented medical condition whereby the shortness of the days in fall and winter leads to depression for many people. Experimental research in psychology and economics indicates that depression, in turn, causes heightened risk aversion. Building on these links between the length of day, depression, and risk aversion, we provide international evidence that stock market returns vary seasonally with the length of the day, a result we call the SAD effect."" Other possibility is that the seasonal results stem from the optimism cycle in which, in the last quarter of the year, investors start looking forward to the next calendar year. At first they are usually too optimistic about the economic outlook (about the growth prospects for the economy and earnings) and this optimism results initially in attractive returns on stocks. However, several months into the year, reality catches up with them. Investors become more pessimistic and the stock market experiences a summer lull. In this way, psychological factors repeatedly make a fool of investors. Therefore, in the six-month period from November through April investors should overweight equities and during the summer period from May through October they should be underweight.","Partially - Selected strategy is a class of ""Market Timing"" strategies which try to rotate out of equities during time of stress. Therefore proposed strategy isn't mainly used as an addon to portfolio to hedge equity risk directly, but it is more an overlay which can be used to manage percentual representation of equities (or ""equity like asssets"") in a portfolio.  ""Equity Market Timing"" strategy can decrease overall risk of equities in a portfolio and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, as strategy's goal is to hold equity market only in a positive times for equity market factor and be out of equities otherwise, therefore this logic can be maybe used to create amended market timing strategy (using original rules) which is out of equities during positive times and holds bonds (or goes short equities) during bad times. This new amended strategy can be maybe used as a hedge/diversification to equity market risk factor during bear markets. However, performance/risk characteristics and overall correlation and quality of suggested ammended strategy can be find out only by rigorous backtest and source academic research paper doesn't give us any clues on how it will perform...","Out of many existing seasonal effects, one is the market maxim “Sell in May and go away” or a Halloween effect. The profitability stems from a simple finding, that on average, stocks deliver close to zero returns in the six-month period from May through October, while giving a risk premium only from November through April. Although, the idea is pretty simple, academic research has found this effect to be profitable and as a more recent research is suggesting, this anomaly could be enhanced, and become even more profitable (more information can be found in our screener). Additionally, this effect is global, since this pattern is present in almost every country in the world. Similar findings can be found for example in the paper of Jacobsen and Bouman: The Halloween Indicator, 'Sell in May and Go Away': Another Puzzle. Quoting the authors: ""We document the existence of a strong seasonal effect in stock returns based on the popular market saying 'Sell in May and go away', also known as the 'Halloween indicator'. According to these words of market wisdom, stock market returns should be higher in the November-April period than those in the May-October period. Surprisingly, we find this inherited wisdom to be true in 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets studied in our sample. The 'Sell in May' effect tends to be particularly strong in European countries and is robust over time."" Although this seasonal indicator appears to be a very powerful stock market timing tool, that has been known for decades, it has not been widely covered in academic literature. Author hypothesize that this may be due to the fact that there is, as yet, no well established consensus about the underlying causes for this remarkable pattern. This could be supported also by Jacobsen and Bouman: ""While we have examined a number of possible explanations, none of these appears to convincingly explain the puzzle."" In spite of disagreement whether the strategy is connected with the optimism cycle, psychology or even another cause, it is imporant that the performance connected with practical usage of the strategy based on this effect is backed by the research.","Be invested in global equity markets during November - April period, stay in cash during May-October period (alternatively go long in  stocks from countries from northern hemisphere during winter period and long in stocks from countries from southern hemisphere during summer period, alternatively go long in cyclical companies during winter period and short defensive stocks and switch positions during the summer period)","Doeswijk: The Optimism Cycle: Sell in Mayhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=643583Abstract:The market maxim ""Sell in May and go away"" is a simple but profitable one. On average, stocks deliver close to zero returns in the six month period from May through October, only giving a risk premium from November through April. This effect, however, has not been widely covered in academic literature. We examine the hypothesis that the seasonal pattern is caused by an optimism cycle. Towards year end, investors start to look towards the new year, often with overly optimistic expectations. This results in attractive returns for stocks. Several months into the year, this initial optimism becomes hard to maintain and the stock market experiences a summer lull. A zero-investment global sector-rotation strategy based on this theory appears to be highly profitable. Global earnings growth revisions also follow a seasonal pattern parallel to that of the stock market. Finally, in a separate analysis for the US stock market, investors' optimism as measured by the initial returns on IPOs almost completely capture the results of the sector-rotation strategy. All these findings support the optimism-cycle hypothesis."

Since then it has been studied and confirmed by countless academics in many international markets. There are a number of ways  to define an earnings surprise (or ways to filter stocks with positive response to earnings) - earnings higher than analysts estimates, earnings higher than some average earnings or stock’s price appreciation during earnings announcement period higher than expected. Each factor shows strong prediction ability for the stock’s future returns, and it is good to use some combination of factors just to enhance the PEAD effect. We present one such strategy from the source paper related to this anomaly. This strategy is presented in its long-short form, but most of the returns come from the long side so it is not a problem to implement it as long only. Research also shows that the main perfmorance contributors are small capitalization stocks therefore caution is recommended during the strategy’s implementation.","The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ except financial and utility firms and stocks with prices less then $5.

EAR is the abnormal return for firm recorded over a three-day window centered on the last announcement date, in excess of the return of a portfolio of firms with similar risk exposures. Stocks are sorted into quintiles based on the EAR and SUE. To avoid look-ahead bias, data from the previous quarter are used to sort stocks. Stocks are weighted equally in each quintile. The investor goes long stocks from intersection of top SUE and EAR quintiles and goes short stocks from the intersection of the bottom SUE and EAR quintiles the second day after actual earnings announcement and holds the portfolio one quarter (or 60 working days). The portfolio is rebalanced every quarter.","Brandt, Kishore, Santa-Clara, Venkatachalam: Earnings Announcements are Full of Surpriseshttp://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~psc/ear.pdfAbstract:We study the drift in returns of portfolios formed on the basis of the stock price reaction around earnings announcements. The Earnings Announcement Return (EAR) captures the market reaction to unexpected information contained in the company’s earnings release. Besides the actual earnings news, this includes unexpected information about sales, margins, investment, and other less tangible information communicated around the earnings announcement. A strategy that buys and sells companies sorted on EAR produces an average abnormal return of 7.55% per year, 1.3% more than a strategy based on the traditional measure of earnings surprise, SUE. The post earnings announcement drift for EAR strategy is stronger than post earnings announcement drift for SUE.

Naturally, it would be logical to use the same logic but adjust the predictor to the actual situation. Net payout yield enhances this ratio because it considers also alternative forms of cash redistribution.Research proved that the cross-sectional relation between total payout yield and returns is more distinct than the relation between dividend yield and returns. This conclusion is reinforced by Fama-MacBeth regressions of returns on beta, size, book-to-market and yield variables in the paper. In these cross sectional-time series regressions, dividend yields show an insignificant association with returns, whereas the payout measures exhibit highly significant associations with returns. Moreover, payout yields show no significant change in their dynamic properties and consequently, their predictive ability remains intact across various time periods. It was also proved that payout yields exhibit significant out-of-sample predictability, whereas dividend yields do not.

For example, The Gordon Growth Model used to determine the ""true"" value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate discounted to the present time. There is a large ammount of literature exploiting the properties of dividends and dividend yields to better understand the fundamentals of asset pricing both in the time series and cross-section.However, more recent academic research started to show deteriorated results in recent years. This confirms also authors Gray and Vogel in the ""Dissecting Shareholder Yield"". The authors states that: ""We confirm on a newer dataset what other research has found; dividend yield no longer works, but more complete measures of shareholder yield hold promise."" The problem of dividends is that they are not the only way that companies are able to distribute their excess cash back to the shareholders. The other possibility how to distribute the cash is a stock repurchase. Stock repurchase is a simple operation, where the company buys back its own shares from the marketplace. This results in a reduced number of existing shares, making each worth a greater percentage of the corporation. Recently, this has become a favorite way for the firms. Adding the fact that there is a growing evidence that stock repurchases has substituted dividends in the last 15-20 years, it is clear that this topic deserves attention from the academic world. This paper suggest a new combined ratio, the ""net payout yield"", combined from the both dividends and stocks repurchases. This results in a very strong predictor of future equity performance, which can be even used in a profitable trading strategy that goes long a portfolio of high yield stocks and short a portfolio of low yield stocks, while rebalancing these holdings on an annual basis.","The investment universe consists of all stocks on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. At the end of June of each year t, 10 portfolios are formed on the basis of ranked values net payout yield. The net payout yield is the ratio of dividends plus repurchases minus common share issuances in year t to year-end market capitalization. There are two measures of payout yield, one based on the statement of cash flows, the other based on the change in Treasury stocks. For the net payout yield, we use the cash flow-based measure of repurchases. The portfolio with the highest net payout yield is bought and held for one year after which it is rebalanced.","Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, Roberts: On the Importance of Measuring Payout Yield: Implications for Empirical Asset Pricing   http://www.nber.org/papers/w10651.pdfAbstract:Previous research showed that the dividend price ratio process changed remarkably during the 1980's and 1990's, but that the total payout ratio (dividends plus repurchases over price) changed very little. We investigate implications of this difference for asset pricing models. In particular, the widely documented decline in the predictive power of dividends for excess stock returns in time series regressions in recent data is vastly overstated. Statistically and economically significant predictability is found at both short and long horizons when total payout yield is used instead of dividend yield. We also provide evidence that total payout yield has information in the cross-section for expected stock returns exceeding that of dividend yield and that the high minus low payout yield portfolio is a priced factor. The evidence throughout is shown to be robust to the method of measuring total payouts."

Per share NCAV, as defined by Graham (Graham and Dodd (1934), Graham (1976)), is the balance sheet current assets minus all the firm's (current and long-term) liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Long-term asset (e.g. intangible assets and fixed assets) values are not counted. Graham found that companies satisfying the NCAV/MV strategy were often priced at significant discounts to estimates of the value that stockholders could receive in the event of the actual sale or liquidation of the entire corporation. Thus, the NCAV/MV rule not only protects capital from significant permanent loss, but also generates a portfolio of stocks with excellent prospects for an advance in price.","The investment universe consists of all stocks on the London Exchange.

In this paper we focus on the early value metric devised and employed by Benjamin Graham - net current asset value to market value (NCAV/MV) - to see if it is still useful in the modern context. Examining stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 1981 to 2005 we observe that those with an NCAV/MV greater than 1.5 display significantly positive market-adjusted returns (annualized return up to 19.7% per year) over five holding years. We allow for the possibility that the phenomenon being observed is due to the additional return experienced on smaller companies (the ""size effect"") and still find an NCAV/MV premium. The profitability of this NCAV/MV strategy in the UK cannot be explained using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Further, Fama and French's three-factor model (FF3M) can not explain the abnormal return of the NCAV/MV strategy. These premiums might be due to irrational pricing."

The hypothesis says that investors are fixed upon earnings and fail to pay attention separately to the cash-flow and accrual components of earnings. However, this is the main reason of the functionality of the accruals anomaly. Firstly, the cash-flow component of earnings is a superior and better forecaster of future earnings, if we would compare it with the accrual component of earnings. Therefore, investors who are not able to distinct between true earnings and accruals can become overly optimistic about the future prospects of firms with high accruals. Moreover, they can become even overly pessimistic about the future prospect of firms with low accruals. Naturally, if we take into account that the aforementioned is not correct, this results in overvalued high accruals firms that subsequently earn low abnormal returns. And vice versa, low accruals firms become undervalued, what is followed by the high abnormal returns. Additionally, a recent research states that there are two different accruals anomalies with interesting implication for the practical usage. Quoting the Detzel, Schaberl and Strauss and their work: ""There are Two Very Different Accruals Anomalies"": ""We document that several well known asset-pricing implications of accruals differ for investment and non-investment-related components. Exposure to an investment-accruals factor explains the cross-section of returns better than the accruals themselves, and this factor’s returns are negatively predicted by sentiment. The opposite results hold for non-investment accruals. Further tests show cash profitability only subsumes long-term non-investment accruals in the cross-section of returns and economy-wide investment accruals negatively predict stock-market returns while other accruals do not. These results challenge existing accruals-anomaly theories and help resolve mixed evidence by showing that the anomaly is two separate phenomena: a risk-based investment accruals premium and a mispricing of non-investment accruals.""","Not known - Source and related research papers don't offer insight into correlation structure of accruals trading strategy to equity market risk, therefore we do not know if this strategy can be used as a hedge/diversification during time of market crisis. Strategy using accruals is usually built as a long-short, but it can be split into 2 parts. Long leg of strategy is surely strongly correlated to equity market however short-only leg can be maybe used as a hedge during bad times. Rigorous backtest is however needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.","The accrual anomaly is deeply connected with the non-cash component of earnings - the accruals. Firstly documented by the Sloan(1996), the accruals anomaly is the negative association between accounting accruals and subsequent stock returns. The theory connected with this particular anomaly is based on the importance of measuring if the company's earnings (as reported by company management) are based on real cash-flow or questionable accounting practices. According to the research, firms with the low levels of accruals are connected with real earnings and on the other hand, firms with the high level of accruals could be a result of some accounting practice. As a result, stocks with low accruals should earn higher market returns than high accruals stocks. Moreover, according to the LaFond and his work ""Is the Accrual Anomaly a Global Anomaly?"", this anomaly is globally present. Quoting the author: "" I investigate the returns implications of accruals in 17 countries over the 1989 to 2003 time period. In general, the results of country-specific analysis indicate that the accrual anomaly is a global phenomenon.""Although, this anomaly could be exploited by acquiring a long position in low accruals companies and a short position in high accruals companies, a more recent research suggest that a simple accruals strategy not only could, but should be enhanced, while using the simple accruals anomaly as a building block. Although, the strategy could not be traded away as easily and is connected with the lower institutional interest, this is caused by the characteristics of high accruals stocks. These stocks are often connected with the small capitalization, some liquidity issues and high transaction costs. For example, Mohanram in the: ""Analysts’ Cash Flow Forecasts and the Decline of the Accruals Anomaly"", states that: ""The accruals anomaly, demonstrated by Sloan (1996), generated significant excess returns consistently for over four decades until 2002, but has apparently weakened in the subsequent period. "" On the other hand, Bender and Nielsen in their paper: ""Earnings Quality Revisited"", have found that the earnings quality signal stopped working in the mid-2000s but since the end of 2008 has staged a remarkable rebound.","The investment universe consists of all stocks on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.

To the extent that this anomaly represents market inefficiency, one would expect sophisticated investors to learn about it and arbitrage the anomaly away. Yet, we show that the accruals anomaly still persists and its magnitude has not declined over time. While we find that institutional investors react promptly to accruals information, it is clear that their reaction is rather weak and is primarily characteristic of active investors who constitute a minority of institutions. The main reason: Extreme accruals firms have characteristics which are unattractive to most institutional investors. Individual investors are by and large unable to profit from trading on accruals information due to the high transaction and information costs associated with implementing a consistently profitable accruals strategy. Consequently, the accruals anomaly persists, and will probably endure."

Although the effect is more pronounced among small-cap and low-price stocks, it also exists for large-cap and for high-price stocks. The effect could exist because of returns at the turn-of-the-year, however it does not. The effect occurs at turns-of-the-month that coincides with turns-of-the-year, but it also occurs during other months. Likewise, the turn-of-the month effect is not concentrated at calendar-year quarter-ends. The reason for functionality also is not a risk based, the paper has explored whether higher “risk” at the turn-of-the-month can explain this pattern. Using standard deviation of return as a measure of risk, it was found that risk is not higher during the four turn-of-the-month days than over the other 16 trading days of the month. This implicates that higher risk does not appear to explain the turn-of-the-month effect. Moreover, also a systematic monthly shift in interest rates does not appear to explain the turn-of-the-month pattern in equity returns. Interestingly,  the turn-of-the-month effect occurs in 30 different markets, so we can conclude that the effect is apparently not due to a factor unique to the U.S. market structure.On the other hand, Ogden (1990) proposes that the turn-of-the-month effect is due to a “regularity in payment” dates in the U.S.  The aforementioned is based on fact that investors receive a preponderance of compensation from employment, dividends and interest at month-ends. Consequently, as investors seek to invest these funds, equity prices are pushed up. Unfortunately, the paper provided tests that reject this hypothesis. The overall problem of finding some reason to functionality is supported also by the work of McConnell and Xu: ""Equity Returns at the Turn of the Month"". Quoting the authors: ""This persistent peculiarity in returns remains a puzzle in search of an answer."" However, most researchers ascribe this effect to the timing of monthly cash flows received by pension funds which are reinvested in the stock market. End of the month is also a natural point for portfolio/trading models rebalancing both for retail and professional investors. The aforementioned could also help this effect to become statistically significant. However, a caution is needed if one implements this strategy as calendar effects tends to vanish or rotate to different days in month.","Not known - Strategy is timing equity market but invests long-only into equity market factor therefore is not suitable as a hedge/diversification during market/economic crises. Strategy's goal is to hold equity market only in a positive times for equity market factor and be out of equities otherwise. This logic can be maybe used to create amended market timing strategy (using original rules) which is out of equities during positive times and holds bonds (or goes short equities) during bad times. This new amended strategy can be maybe used as a hedge/diversification to equity market risk factor during bear markets. However, performance/risk characteristics and overall correlation and quality of suggested ammended strategy can be find out only by rigorous backtest and source academic research paper doesn't give us any clues on how it will perform...","Lakonishok and Smidt (1988) were the first to have reported a turn-of-the month seasonal in equity returns. The beginning of turn-of-the-month period is defined as the last trading day of the month and ending with the third trading day of the following month. More precisely, the researchers have found that, on average, the four days at the turn-of-the-month account for all of the positive return to the DJIA over the period of 1897-1986. Since then, a lot of research have been made on this topic and this paper also deals with this anomaly, but with a more recent and wider set of data. The pattern in returns over the period of the paper is remarkably similar to the pattern over the earlier time period. Interestingly, in the more recent period, we can conclude the same pattern as in the work of Lakonishok and Smidt, virtually all of the excess market return is accrued during the four-day turn-of-the-month period and investors received little or no reward for bearing the market risk over the other 16 trading days of the month. Despite the simplicity of the trading strategy based on this anomaly (for example to buy SPY ETF 1day before end of the month and to sell it 3rd trading day of the new month at the close), the strategy is both profitable and statistically significant. Moreover, this anomaly cannot be explained by the known asset pricing models. To sum it up, the turn of the month is a well known effect on stock indexes, with a simple idea that stocks prices usually increase during the last four days and the first three days of each month. This supports for example the Carchano and Tornero in the ""Calendar Anomalies in Stock Index Futures"". Quoting the authors: ""our analysis reveals that the turn-of-the-month effect in S&P 500 futures contracts is the only calendar effect that is statistically and economically significant and persistent over time.""","Buy SPY ETF 1day (some papers says 4 days) before end of the month and sell 3rd trading day of the new month at the close.","Xu, McConnell: Equity Returns at the Turn of the Monthhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=917884Abstract:      A turn-of-the-month effect in U.S. equity returns was initially identified by Lakonishok and Smidt (1988) using the DJIA for the period 1897-1986. According to the turn-of-the-month effect, equity returns over the interval beginning the last trading day of the month and ending three days later are significantly higher than over other days. Using CRSP daily returns, we find that the turn-of-the-month effect persists over the recent interval of 1987-2005: in essence, over this 19-year period (and over the 109-year period of 1897-2005) all of the excess market return occurred during the four-day turn-of-the-month interval. Thus, during the other 16 trading days of the month, on average, investors received no reward for bearing market risk. We further find that the turn-of-the-month effect is not confined to small or low-priced stocks; it is not confined to the December-January turn-of-the-month; it is not confined to calendar-quarter-ends; it is not confined to the U.S.; and it is not due to market risk as traditionally measured: the standard deviation of returns at the turn-of-the-month is no higher than during other days.

In this model, market forces are unable to prevent overpricing in the amount of shorting costs when these costs are high. The greater the shorting costs, the greater the possible overpricing, and therefore, the lower the subsequent stock returns. The second and probably more valid explanation is the information hypothesis. The information hypothesis builds on a broadening base of empirical research demonstrating that short sellers are well informed traders.

Therefore, the common sense implies that it should be possible to gain an advantage of the aforementioned stocks. The theory says that shorting stocks with all the constrains (connected with the shorting) is most often made by the informed investors whose activity ultimately helps prices incorporate more information. Moreover, the level of their holdings has predictive power about returns and fundamentals of the stocks.

Two popular explanations suggest very different interpretations. According to Miller (1977), stocks are overvalued in the presence of short-sale constraints, and the subsequent negative abnormal returns represent a correction of this overvaluation. Based on recent evidence in the accounting and microstructure literature, an alternative explanation is that short sellers are highly informed traders and short interest, therefore, predicts future returns due to its information content. We discriminate between the overvaluation and the information hypotheses and find support for the latter. Therefore, our evidence suggests that short sellers act as specialized monitors who generate value-relevant information in the stock market."

The first possible explanation for the short interest effect - the overvaluation hypothesis stems from the work of Miller (1977). His theory says, that stocks with high levels of short interest are overvalued because pessimistic investors are unable to establish short positions, leaving only the optimists to participate in the pricing process. In this model, market forces are unable to prevent overpricing in the amount of shorting costs when these costs are high. The greater the shorting costs, the greater the possible overpricing, and therefore, the lower the subsequent stock returns. The second and probably more valid explanation is the information hypothesis. The information hypothesis builds on a broadening base of empirical research demonstrating that short sellers are well informed traders. The aforementioned could be the reason for the functionality, because if one follows the decisions of the short-sale practitioners, whose tend to be investors with superior analytical skills (for example according to the research of Gutfleish and Atzil, 2004). The main idea is simple, the research says, that this type typically initiate short positions only if they can infer low fundamental valuation from public sources. For example, short sellers may engage in forensic accounting, looking for high levels of accrual as evidence of hidden bad news, but there is a large ammount of possibilities than just accruals.","No - Selected strategy is designed as a long-only therefore it can't be used as a hedge against market drops as a lot of strategy's performance comes from equity market premium (as investor holds equities therefore his correlation to broad equity market is very very high).","In the past, academic research has proved that stocks with the high levels of short interest are connected with a high probability to subsequently experience negative abnormal returns. Therefore, the common sense implies that it should be possible to gain an advantage of the aforementioned stocks. The theory says that shorting stocks with all the constrains (connected with the shorting) is most often made by the informed investors whose activity ultimately helps prices incorporate more information. Moreover, the level of their holdings has predictive power about returns and fundamentals of the stocks. Knowing the short-interest can lead to a strategy that consists of simply joining informed short-sellers. Additionally, if we consider only the long-leg of the possible strategy, an easily shorted stock that is completely avoided by short sellers suggests unanimity among market participants that the stock is, at a minimum, not overvalued. Academic research not only supports this theory, but it has shown that it is profitable to own stocks with very low short interest. Therefore, the trading strategy simply consists of holding stocks with the low short interest. Overally, the academic world support this anomaly, for example Asquith, Pathak and Ritter in their work ""Short Interest, Institutional Ownership, and Stock Returns"", say that ""Stocks are short sale constrained when there is a strong demand to sell short and a limited supply of shares to borrow.

We show that stocks with relatively high short interest subsequently experience negative abnormal returns, but the effect can be transient and of debatable economic significance. In contrast, we find that relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns. These positive returns are often larger (in absolute value) than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks. Because stocks with greater short interest are priced more accurately, our results suggest that short selling promotes market efficiency. However, we show that positive information associated with low short interest, which is publicly available, is only slowly incorporated into prices, which raises a broader market efficiency issue. Our results also cast doubt on existing theories of the impact of short sale constraints."

Therefore proposed strategy isn't mainly used as an addon to portfolio to hedge equity risk directly, but it is more an overlay which can be used to manage percentual representation of equities (or ""equity like asssets"") in a portfolio.  ""Equity Market Timing"" strategy can decrease overall risk of equities in a portfolio and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, as strategy's goal is to hold equity market only in a positive times for equity market factor and be out of equities otherwise, therefore this logic can be maybe used to create amended market timing strategy (using original rules) which is out of equities during positive times and holds bonds (or goes short equities) during bad times. This new amended strategy can be maybe used as a hedge/diversification to equity market risk factor during bear markets. However, performance/risk characteristics and overall correlation and quality of suggested ammended strategy can be find out only by rigorous backtest and source academic research paper doesn't give us any clues on how it will perform...","FED Model (a favorite name for a model which uses aggregate equity market earnings yield and long-term bond yields to predict equity returns - the greater is gap in behalf of stocks, the greater are their subsequent returns and vice-versa) is one of the most controversial models used by practitioners and academics. Countless studies have been written on this subject. Some of them rejected it and others defended it. However summary evidence shows that the gap between the earnings yield and the 10 year treasury yield has some predictive power on short term horizons during the last 40-50 years. We present a simple strategy which uses the difference between earnings yield and bond yield as an independent variable in a regression equation used to predict equity excess return and then uses that prediction as an input to market timing decision. The strategy could be improved by using other variables like the term spread or FED funds premium.","Each month, the investor conducts a 1 month predictive regression (using all available data up to that date) predicting excess stock market returns using the yield gap as independent variable. The ""Yield gap"" is calculated as YG = EY − y, with earnings yield EY ≡ ln (1 ++ E/P) and y = ln (1 ++ Y) is the log 10 year Treasury bond yield. Then, the strategy allocates 100% in the risky asset if the forecasted excess returns are positive and otherwise it invests 100% in the risk-free rate.","Asness: The FED model and expected asset returnshttp://www.ebs.edu/fileadmin/redakteur/funkt.dept.finance/DGF/downloads/Paper/No-164.pdfAbstract:The earnings yield and long-term bond yields have been widely used to predict asset returns. In this paper, I focus on the predictive role of the stock-bond ""yield gap"" - the difference between the earnings yield and the 10 year Treasury bond yield - also know as the FED model, and which can be interpreted as a long term yield spread of stocks relative to bonds. Conditional on other forecasting variables, the yield gap forecasts positive excess stock returns, both at short and long forecasting horizons, although the forecasting power is greater at the near horizons. On the other hand, the yield gap forecasts negative excess returns for bonds, at both short and long horizons. A VAR variance decomposition for stock market returns, shows that shocks in the yield gap are highly positively correlated with innovations in both future discount-rate and cash flow news, confirming that the spread conveys information about future earnings and returns. An investment strategy based on the forecasting ability of the Yield gap produces higher Sharpe ratios than passive strategies in both the market index and long-term bond. In the context of an equilibrium multifactor ICAPM, the yield gap has some explanatory power over the cross section of stock returns."

Firms maintain a mix of growth options and assets in place, but growth options are inherently more risky than assets in place. As firms exercise growth options, the asset mix of the firm becomes less risky as assets in place displace growth options. The systematic reduction in risk following the exercise of growth options induces a negative correlation between investment and subsequent returns. However, empirical findings are all also consistent with systematic mispricing across asset growth as a firm characteristic. Therefore, the authors are unable to recognize whether the return premium for low growth stocks is due to systematic variation in risk or the return reversal caused by systematic over capitalization of high growth stocks and undercapitalization of low growth stocks. Building on that, another past research has concluded that the asset growth effect is not fully explained by variations in risk. However, there is a possibility that the effect is atleast partially due to the systematic market mispricing of growing businesses. That source of mispricing could be caused by the extrapolation of past gains to growth for high asset growth companies. A good insight on the reasons for functionality could be found in the work of Kam and Wei: ""Asset Growth Reversals and Investment Anomalies"". Quoting the authors: ""We simultaneously test the prominent rational and behavioral explanations of the negative relations between corporate asset growth or investments and subsequent stock returns by extensively examining the effects of realized and predicted subsequent growth on the relations. We find: (i) returns on low growth firms with low subsequent growth are not higher than those on high growth firms with high subsequent growth; (ii) high growth firms that have high subsequent growth do not underperform and the return spreads between low and high growth firms are lower when high growth firms have higher subsequent growth; (iii) the relations between growth and returns are weak or even in opposite direction when subsequent growth tend not to reverse but are significantly negative when subsequent growth tend to reverse and are stronger when the reversals are more extreme. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis based on extrapolation and growth-based style investing but less consistent with the other explanations.""","Not known - Source and related research papers don't offer insight into correlation structure of proposed trading strategy to equity market risk, therefore we do not know if this strategy can be used as a hedge/diversification during time of market crisis. Strategy is built as a long-short, but it can be split into 2 parts. Long leg of strategy is surely strongly correlated to equity market however short-only leg can be maybe used as a hedge during bad times. Rigorous backtest is however needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.","Academic research has proved that the one of the most available pieces of business data—the growth in the book value of assets could be very valuable for investors. Aforementioned data can be utilized in a popular trading strategy based on the growth effect anomaly. There is a strong asset growth effect in U.S. stock returns and this paper updates the previous results of Cooper, Gulen, and Schill. The idea is simple, on a risk adjusted basis, low asset growth stocks significantly outperforms high asset growth stocks. This effect is consistent over time with the returns of low asset growth stocks exceed those of high asset growth stocks in 90% (equal weighted) or 72% (value weighted) of the calendar years in the sample of the paper. Additionally, despite a return differential is larger among small capitalization stocks, the authors have shown that the effect is still economically and statistically large also among large capitalization stocks. Therefore, the strategy could be easily implemented with only small trading and slippage costs. Interestingly, authors state that a firm’s growth rate in assets is at least as powerful in explaining returns as other well known effects such as size, book-to-market, return momentum and reversals. Moreover, the proposed strategy which consists of buying low asset growth stocks and selling the high asset growth stocks has a low correlation to the equity market factor. Similar results can be found for example in the work of Watanabe, Xu, Yao and Yu: ""The Asset Growth Effect: Insights from International Equity Markets"". The authors says that stocks with higher asset growth rates experience lower future returns in 40 international equity markets, consistent with the U.S. evidence documented by Cooper et al. (2008). This negative effect of asset growth on stock return is stronger in developed markets and in markets where stocks are more efficiently priced.","The investment universe consists of all non-financial U.S. stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.

Over the past 40 years, low asset growth stocks have maintained a return premium of 20% per year over high asset growth stocks. The asset growth return premium begins in January following the measurement year and persists for up to five years. The firm asset growth rate maintains an economically and statistically important ability to forecast returns in both large capitalization and small capitalization stocks. In the cross-section of stock returns, the asset growth rate maintains large explanatory power with respect to other previously documented determinants of the cross-section of returns (i.e., size, prior returns, book-to-market ratios). We conclude that risk-based explanations have some difficulty in explaining such a large and consistent return premium."

The equity universe is broad and therefore it is time-consuming to look for pairs which are correlated or cointegrated (aka. they move together). ETFs provide a much smaller universe and they have one great advantage (compared to stocks) - the ETF is a portfolio of stocks and is therefore more resilient to unexpected news related to a single stock (this often breaks a promising convergence in stock's pairs).

Rolling into the second nearest contract is done at the beginning of the delivery month.The contract is defined as the high- (low-) volume contract if the contract's volume changes between period from t-1 to t and period from t-2 to t-1 is above (below) the median volume change of all contracts (weekly trading volume is detrended by dividing the trading volume by its sample mean to make the volume measure comparable across markets).All contracts are also assigned to either high-open interest (top 50% of changes in open interest) or low-open interest groups (bottom 50% of changes in open interest) based on lagged changes in open interest between period from t-1 to t and period from t-2 to t-1. The investor goes long (short) on futures from the high-volume, low-open interest group with the lowest (greatest) returns in the previous week. The weight of each contract is proportional to the difference between the return of the contract over the past 1 week and the equal-weighted average of returns on the N (number of contracts in group) contracts during that period.","Wang, Yu: Trading activity and price reversals in futures marketshttp://www.paper.edu.cn/scholar/showpdf/OUT2ANwINTz0YxeQhhttp://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changyun_Wang/publication/222566966_Trading_activity_and_price_reversals_in_futures_markets/links/0a85e534c557c897ae000000.pdfAbstract:We use the standard contrarian portfolio approach to examine short-horizon return predictability in 24 US futures markets. We find strong evidence of weekly return reversals, similar to the findings from equity market studies. When interacting between past returns and lagged changes in trading activity (volume and/or open interest), we find that the profits to contrarian portfolio strategies are, on average, positively associated with lagged changes in trading volume, but negatively related to lagged changes in open interest. We also show that futures return predictability is more pronounced if interacting between past returns and lagged changes in both volume and open interest. Our results suggest that futures market overreaction exists, and both past prices and trading activity contain useful information about future market movements. These findings have implications for futures market efficiency and are useful for futures market participants, particularly commodity pool operators."

The return on earnings announcements is essentially unrelated to market risk or to any of the other factors commonly used in asset pricing. The premium is strong in large capitalization stocks, is not only confined to a three-day window around the announcement (but for whole month), and has appeared consistently since 1927.

Pre-holiday days on the market are often characterized with lower liquidity as a lot of market participants are not involved in the market or they lower their exposure.

The downside of having to control for a large number of possible calendar effects is that it diminish the power and makes it harder to detect real anomalies. This paper contributes to the discussion of calendar effects and their significance. We derive a test for calendar specific anomalies, which controls for the full space of possible calendar effects. This test achieves good power properties by exploiting a particular correlation structure, and its main advantage is that it is capable of producing data-mining robust significance. We apply the test to stock indices from Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, UK, and USA. Our findings are that calendar effects are significant in most series, and it is primarily end-of-the-year effects that exhibit the largest anomalies. In recent years it seems that the calendar effects have diminished except in small cap stock indices."

When good news has pushed a stock’s price near or to a new 52-week high, traders are reluctant to bid the price of the stock higher even if the information warrants it.

Investors use the 52-week high as an “anchor” which they value stocks against. When stock prices are near the 52-week high, investors are unwilling to bid the price all the way to the fundamental value. As a result, investors under-react when stock prices approach the 52-week high, and this creates the 52-week high effect. This effect could be enhanced with a strategy using a narrower investment universe and buying stocks in industries in which stock prices are close to 52-week highs. The strategy is related to the momentum effect but research shows it is independent of it. The strategy should not be implemented in January as it has negative results in this month (like momentum). Most of the gains for the long-short version are from long positions, which makes the “52-week high effect” easier to implement in real-world trading.","The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ (the research paper used the CRSP database for backtesting). The ratio between the current price and 52-week high is calculated for each stock at the end of each month (PRILAG i,t = Price i,t / 52-Week High i,t). Every month, the investor then calculates the weighted average of ratios (PRILAG i,t) from all firms in each industry (20 industries are used), where the weight is the market capitalization of the stock at the end of month t. The winners (losers) are stocks in the six industries with the highest (lowest) weighted averages of PRILAGi,t. The investor buys stocks in the winner portfolio and shorts stocks in the loser portfolio and holds them for three months. Stocks are weighted equally and the portfolio is rebalanced monthly (which means that 1/3 of the portfolio is rebalanced each month).","Hong, Jordan, Liu: Industry Information and the 52-Week High Effecthttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1787378Abstract:We find that the 52-week high effect (George and Hwang, 2004) cannot be explained by risk factors. Instead, it is more consistent with investor under-reaction caused by anchoring bias: the presumably more sophisticated institutional investors suffer less from this bias and buy (sell) stocks close to (far from) their 52-week highs. Further, the effect is mainly driven by investor under-reaction to industry instead of firm-specific information. The extent of under-reaction is more for positive than for negative industry information. A strategy that buys stocks in industries in which stock prices are close to 52-week highs and shorts stocks in industries in which stock prices are far from 52-week highs generates a monthly return of 0.60% from 1963 to 2009, roughly 50% higher than the profit from the individual 52-week high strategy in the same period. The 52-week high strategy works best among stocks with high R-squares and high industry betas (i.e., stocks whose values are more affected by industry factors and less affected by firm-specific information). Our results hold even after controlling for both individual and industry return momentum effects."

Therefore proposed strategy isn't mainly used as an addon to portfolio to hedge equity risk directly, but it is more an overlay which can be used to manage percentual representation of equities (or ""equity like asssets"") in a portfolio.  ""Equity Market Timing"" strategy can decrease overall risk of equities in a portfolio and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, as strategy's goal is to hold equity market only in a positive times for equity market factor and be out of equities otherwise, therefore this logic can be maybe used to create amended market timing strategy (using original rules) which is out of equities during positive times and holds bonds (or goes short equities) during bad times. This new amended strategy can be maybe used as a hedge/diversification to equity market risk factor during bear markets.

Simple logic says that oil prices should predict economy’s performance and therefore should also have some predictive ability for equity returns. Academic research confirms it and what’s more - it shows that oil isn‘t the only commodity with prediction ability (prices of some industrial metals could also be used as equity indicators). Higher oil prices predict lower future equity returns and vice versa. Therefore a simple market timing system which is using oil prices as an indicator to time equities can be constructed.","Several types of oil can be used (Brent, WTI, Dubai etc.) without big differences in results. The source paper for this anomaly uses Arab Light crude oil. Monthly oil returns are used in the regression equation as an independent variable and equity returns are used as a dependent variable. The model is re-estimated every month and observations of the last month are added. The investor determines whether the expected stock market return in a specific month (based on regression results and conditional on the oil price change in the previous month) is higher or lower than the risk-free rate. The investor is fully invested in the market portfolio if the expected return is higher (bull market); he invests in cash if the expected return is lower (bear market).","Driesprong, Jacobsen, Maat: Striking Oil: Another Puzzle?http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=460500Abstract:Changes in oil prices predict stock market returns worldwide. In our thirty year sample of monthly returns for developed stock markets, we find statistically significant predictability for twelve out of eighteen countries as well as for the world market index. Results are similar for our shorter time series of emerging markets. We find no evidence that our results can be explained by time varying risk premia. Even though oil price shocks increase risk, investors seem to underreact to information in the price of oil: a rise in oil prices does not lead to higher stock market returns, but drastically lowers returns. For instance, an oil price shock of one standard deviation (around 10 percent) predictably lowers world market returns by one percent. Oil price changes also significantly predict negative excess returns. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a delayed reaction by investors to oil price changes. In line with this hypothesis the relation between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes becomes substantially stronger once we introduce lags of several trading days between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes."

This difference in average weekly returns is evident in two dimensions, both relative to the other non-third-Friday weekly returns for the respective stock and relative to the third-Friday weekly returns for smaller stocks. By contrast, the average third-Friday weekly stock returns are not different than other weeks over a pre-option-market sample period from 1948 to 1972. To probe further, we investigate ties to option open interest and option volume. First, we find that option open interest decreases appreciably during the third-Friday week and that call trading is high during the third-Friday week, relative to both the underlying stock volume and the put volume. Second, patterns in call trading by non-market-makers suggest that the call-related delta exposure of market makers tends to decline appreciably during the option-expiration week. Third, we find that the average weekly stock returns are especially high for option-expiration weeks that also experience a high call trading volume, relative to the underlying stock volume.

January barometer is a calendar anomaly which says that equity index returns from February to December could be forecasted by the January performance of the particular equity index. The theory says, that a strong January should predict strong performance of the whole year and vice versa. Although, following Januarys in which the market return was positive, the average market return over the following 11 months was significantly higher than the average market return over the 11 months following Januarys in which the market return was negative, this strategy should be taken with caution. While the January Barometer should contain valuable information (however it may be just a data mining), the Barometer would have led an investor to be long the market during four of the five worst 11 month post-January intervals over the 152 years long backtesting period. Moreover, the simple long/short strategy of index would also lead the investor into disasterous short trades during bull markets. The aforementioned negative outcomes could be partially eliminated by the usage of long position in equity index combined with the bonds, but it is still questionable whether the strategy is rationally based, or is the product of upward trend of equities through the long time. However, according to the paper, the best usage of this barometer is the combination of equity index and treasury bonds. With a simple rule to long index after a strong January or to buy bonds after weak January. The aforementioned strategy should outperform passive long only strategy through the whole backtesting period, the long/short strategy according to Januarys and the long leg only of the January barometer strategy.","Invest in equity market in each January.

This adage has become known as the January Barometer. In an earlier paper (Cooper, McConnell and Ovtchinnikov, 2006) we investigated the power of the January market return to predict returns for the next 11 months using 147 years of U.S. stock market returns. We found that, on average, the 11-month holding period return following positive Januarys was significantly higher, by a wide margin, than the 11-month holding period return following negative Januarys. In this paper we update that analysis through 2008 and address the question of how an investor can best use that information as part of an investment strategy. We find that the best way to use the January Barometer is not the obvious one of being long following positive Januarys and short following negative Januarys, but to be long following positive Januarys and invest in t-bills following negative Januarys. This strategy beats various alternatives, including a passive long-the-marketall-the-time strategy, by significant margins over the 152 years for which we have data."

This paper overally states that this anomaly should work and is significant, however, if we would consider also another reasearch, the conclusions become mixed. For example, Haug and Hirschey in the ""The January Effect"" say that: ""The January effect in small cap stock returns is remarkably consistent over time, and does not appear to have been affected by passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This finding adds new perspective to the traditional tax-loss selling hypothesis, and suggests the potential relevance of behavioral explanations.

But the research of Anthony Yanxiang Gu - ""The Declining January Effect: Evidences from the U.S. Equity Markets"" says that: ""The January effect exhibits a pronounced declining trend for both large and small firm stock indices since 1988 and the effect is disappearing for the Russell indices. The downward trend is more apparent for indices containing small stocks than for indices of large stocks."".

The anomaly itself is old (Keim,1983), therefore it has been widely researched and is well-known in the academic world or between practicioners. The anomaly says that returns of the small cap stocks are particulary strong in the January. Although the strategy based on this anomaly is well-documented, the strategy is connected with certain problems. Firstly, there were unusually high January returns during the 1960s and 1970s or the years which formed the sample examined by Keim (1983) in his seminal study and which are frequently used as a benchmark in studies of the temporal behavior of the anomaly. However, this paper has found that the magnitude of the effect quite similar to what it was before the spike. Moreover, evidence does not suggest that investors are learning of the effect and are arbitraging it away. Additionaly, the effect should be present at all the major stocks exchanges (NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ - if we would consider the small stocks). But in the last several years, the returns were very low. In the recent period, the January effect was so small that the transaction costs make it impossible to trade this anomaly and the anomaly has become unprofitable.This could be quite confusing, because on one hand (according to some papers), the January effect should be alive and well, and should continue to present a daunting challenge to the Efficient Market Hypothesis. On the other hand, this anomaly is starting to look more like the result of data mining than a real market anomaly and should not be traded at all.","Invest into small cap stocks at the beginning of each January.

First, we find that January returns are smaller after 1963-1979, but have simply reverted to levels that existed before that time. Second, we show that the January effect is not limited to mature markets but also appears in firms trading on the relatively new NASDAQ exchange in the 1970s. Third, trading volume for small firms in December and January is not different from other months, implying that traders are not actively arbitraging the anomaly.

Traditional momentum uses a universe of assets to pick past winners, and it predicts that those winners will continue to outperform their peers in the future as well. However, recent academic research shows that we do not need the whole universe of assets to exploit the momentum effect. A new version of this anomaly (Time Series Momentum) shows that each security’s (or asset's) own past return is a future predictor. The past 12-month excess return of each instrument is a positive predictor of its future return. A diversified portfolio of time series momentum across all assets is remarkably stable and robust, yielding a high Sharpe ratio with little correlation to passive benchmarks. An additional advantage is that time series momentum returns appear to be largest when the stock market's returns are most extreme; hence, time series momentum may be a hedge for extreme events.","The investment universe consists of 24 commodity futures, 12 cross-currency pairs (with 9 underlying currencies), 9 developed equity indices, and 13 developed government bond futures.Every month, the investor considers whether the excess return of each asset over the past 12 months is positive or negative and goes long on the contract if it is positive and short if negative. The position size is set to be inversely proportional to the instrument’s volatility. A univariate GARCH model is used to estimated ex-ante volatility in the source paper.

A diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors, and performs best during extreme markets.

There is strong evidence stocks have distinct expected returns in January, February, ... December. The estimated seasonal variation in expected returns is positive in every calendar month and especially high during October, December, and January. This structure is independent of industry, size, and earnings announcements. These results support the inclusion of seasonal structure into asset-pricing models."

The returns on the dollar carry trade are uncorrelated with the returns on the high-minus-low global currency carry trade, which is dollar neutral, but the dollar carry trade offers even higher Sharpe ratios. Using a no-arbitrage model of exchange rates, we show that these excess returns compensate U.S. investors for taking on U.S. speciffc risk by shorting the dollar in U.S. recessions, and for taking on global risk by going long in the dollar in bad times. The model implies that countries whose exposures to global shocks differ substantially from the average exhibit much less currency return predictability, a prediction that we show is borne out by the data."

This strategy has been academically confirmed many times, but a lot of researchers have documented several momentum drawbacks. One important characteristic is that traditional momentum has substantial time-varying exposures to the classical Fama and French factors. Academic research shows that momentum loads positively (negatively) on systematic factors when these factors have positive (negative) returns during the formation period of the momentum strategy. As a consequence, a conventional total return momentum strategy experiences losses when the sign of the factor returns over the holding period is opposite to the sign over the formation period. One example is that negative market returns in the credit crises of 2008 caused the total return momentum to be tilted towards the low-beta segment of the market in early 2009. When the market recovered in the first quarter of 2009, the total return momentum’s negative market beta caused large losses. Luckily, the same academic research offers a solution. A residual momentum strategy based on residual returns estimated using the Fama and French three-factor model offers smaller time-varying factor exposures (which reduces the volatility of the strategy) and has a higher long-run average Sharpe ratio. A higher strategy consistency, large cap investment universe and a lower concentration in the extremes of the cross-section of stocks is an added bonus.","The investment universe consists of all domestic, primary stocks listed on the New York (NYSE), American (AMEX), and NASDAQ stock markets with a price higher than $1.

As a consequence, residual momentum earns risk-adjusted profits that are about twice as large as those associated with total return momentum; is more consistent over time; and less concentrated in the extremes of the cross-section of stocks.

Delisted2 companies were included to account for survivorship bias3. Realistic transaction cost estimates (slippage & commission) were applied. Liquidity filters were used to limit hypothetical trading to only stocks that would have been liquid enough to trade, at the time of the trade. Coverage included 24,000+ securities spanning 22 years.

Strategy is built as a long-short, but it can be split into 2 parts. Long leg of strategy is surely strongly correlated to equity market however short-only leg can be maybe used as a hedge during bad times. Rigorous backtest is however needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.","Momentum is a simple well-known trading strategy that buys stocks with the best returns over the past three to 12 months and sells stocks with the worst returns over the same horizon. Many tweaks to the basic momentum strategy have been published in academic papers. Momentum combined with a volatility effect is one such useful trick as research shows that momentum returns could be enhanced by using the most volatile stocks. An additional advantage of this approach is that it works very well within large cap stocks (it is well-known that momentum works better in a small cap universe; therefore, any trick which works within large caps is helpful).","The investment universe consists of NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks with prices higher than $5 per share. At the beginning of each month, the sample is divided into equal halves, at the size median, and only larger stocks are used. Then each month, realized returns and realized (annualized) volatilities are calculated for each stock for the past six months. One week (seven calendar days) prior to the beginning of each month is skipped to avoid biases due to microstructures. Stocks are then sorted into quintiles based on their realized past return and past volatility. The investor goes long on stocks from the highest performing quintile from the highest volatility group and short on stocks from the lowest performing quintile from the highest volatility group. Stocks are equally weighted and held for 6 months (therefore 1/6 of the portfolio is rebalanced every month).","Wei: Do Momentum and Reversals Coexist?http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1679464Abstract:The answer to the title question is ""Yes."" Examining stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ for the period of 1964 to 2009, this study discovers that, while momentum prevails among small stocks, momentum and reversals coexist among large stocks for a holding period of up to six months. The momentum/reversal divide is along the volatility dimension: Large-cap/low-volatility stocks exhibit reversals while large-cap/high-volatility stocks experience momentum. This new discovery cannot be fully rationalized with either risk-based or behavioral-based explanations."

The main reasons for anomaly persistence are behavioral biases like investor herding, investor over and underreaction and confirmation bias. Another natural interpretation of momentum profits is that stocks underreact to information. For example, if a firm releases good news and the stock price only reacts partially to the good news, then buying the stock after the initial release of the news will generate profits.","No - Pure long only equity momementum strategy implicitly can't be used as a hedge. Long-short equity momentum factor is also a troublesome for hedging as a momentum factor is prone to ""momentum crashes"". Equity momentum factor performs well during first stages of crises (as it usually shorts stocks with astrong downward momemtum and buys stocks which are not falling fast). Momentum crashes usually occurred right as the market rebounded following large previous declines. One explanation for this pattern is the time-varying systematic risk of the momentum strategy because momentum has significant negative beta following bear markets. Numerous amended versions of basic momentum strategy appeared after 2008 bear market. These adjusted strategies may offer better hedge against equity market risk.","The momentum anomaly is one of the strongest and oldest academically described anomalies. However, is it easily exploitable? Academic research usually uses portfolios filled by thousands of stocks to compute momentum factor returns. But this is not possible for small retail investors with small portfolios. They are constrained compared to big hedge funds and cannot diversify so well. Recent academic research shows that a small portfolio is not a problem in a momentum investing. The momentum effect could be easily captured even with a portfolio consisting of up to 50 stocks.","The investment universe consists of all UK listed companies (this is the investment universe used in the source academic study and it could be easily changed into any other market - see Ammann, Moellenbeck, Schmid: Feasible Momentum Strategies in the US Stock Market). Stocks with the lowest market capitalization (25% of the universe) are excluded due to liquidity reasons. Momentum profits are calculated by ranking companies on the basis of their stock market performance over the previous 12 months (the rank period). The investor goes long in the 10 stocks with the highest performance and goes short in the10 stocks with the lowest performance. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced yearly.

Individual traders are not in a financial position to buy and sell short hundreds of firms, as suggested by existing academic research, and thus this study uses extreme performance companies to implement the strategy. We find that strong momentum gains appear when extreme winners and losers are employed. These returns remain strong even after considering the transaction costs of implementing such strategies, including commissions, stamp duty, selling-short costs, and bid-ask spread. Overall, we show that a relatively large number of small investors can enjoy momentum gains, providing some evidence against stock market efficiency."

The study then demonstrates the profitability of shorting VIX futures contracts when the basis is in contango and buying VIX futures contracts when the basis is in backwardation with the market exposure of these positions hedged with mini-S&P 500 futures positions. The results indicate that these trading strategies are highly profitable and robust to transaction costs, out of sample hedge ratio forecasts and risk management rules.

Now, evidence for using long-short value factor portfolio as a hedge against equity market is a very mixed. Firstly, there are a lot of definitions of value factor (from a simple standard P/B ratios to various more complex definition as in this strategy) and performance of different value factors really differ in times of stress. But there are multiple research papers in a tone of work of Cakici and Tan : ""Size, Value, and Momentum in Developed Country Equity Returns: Macroeconomic and Liquidity Exposures"" that link value factor premium to liquidity and growth risk and shows that the implication is that value factor returns can be low prior to periods of low global economic growth and bad liquidity.","Investors have always tried to asses whether the equity market is cheap or dear. Various methodologies have been used for this purpose, but most of them try to compare the actual price of equities to an internal value derived from equity earnings or book values. Numerous academic research papers show that equity valuation has a predictive ability for future equity returns. However, its power is limited to very long holding periods (5-10 years) as noise and various behavioral effects cause prices to deviate quite substantially from ‘fair’ values, often for many years. A rotational trading strategy which periodically rotates to countries with the most undervalued equity markets helps to get around these problems.","The investment universe consists of 32 countries with easily accessible equity markets (via ETFs for example).

Robert Shiller popularized this method with his version of this cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) in the late 1990s, and issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years. We apply this valuation metric across over thirty foreign markets and find it both practical and useful, and indeed witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the United States. We then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios based on valuation, and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation."

The high-quality earnings firms are characterized by high cash flows (relative to reported earnings) while the low-quality firms are characterized by high reported earnings (relative to cash flow).The second factor is based on return on equity (ROE) to exploit the well-documented “profitability anomaly” by going long high-ROE firms (top 30%) and short low-ROE firms (bottom 30%).The third ratio - CF/A (cash flow to assets) factor goes long firms with high cash flow to total assets.The fourth ratio - D/A (debt to assets) factor goes long firms with low leverage and short firms with high leverage.Investor builds a scored composite quality metric by computing the percentile score of each stock on each of the four quality metrics (where “good” quality has a high score, so ideally a stock has low accruals, low leverage, high ROE, and high cash flow) and then add up the percentiles to get a score for each stock from 0 to 400. He then forms the composite factor by going long the top 30% of small cap stocks and also large cap stocks and short the bottom 30% of small cap stock and also large cap stocks and cap-weighting individual stocks within the portfolios.Final factor portfolio is formed at the end of the each June and is rebalanced yearly.","Kozlov, Petajisto: Global Return Premiums on Earnings Quality, Value, and Sizehttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2179247Abstract:We investigate the return premium on stocks with high earnings quality using a broad and recent global dataset covering all developed markets from 7/1988 to 6/2012. We find that a simple strategy that is long stocks with high earnings quality and short stocks with low earnings quality produces a higher Sharpe ratio than the overall market or similar strategies betting on value or small stocks. This result holds both in the overall sample as well as in the more recent time period since 2005. Because the global earnings quality portfolio has a negative correlation with a value portfolio, an investor wishing to invest in both exposures can achieve significant diversification benefits."

Research shows that option excess returns reflect the different exposure to disagreement risk. Investors who buy options of firms which are more prone to heterogeneity in beliefs are compensated in equilibrium for holding this risk. Volatility risk premia of individual and index options represent compensation for the priced disagreement risk. Hence, in the cross-section of options the volatility risk premium depends on the size of belief heterogeneity of this particular firm and the business cycle indicator. As the risk-neutral skewness, the volatility risk premium for index options can be larger or smaller depending on the size of disagreement and of the firm’s share.","No - Absolutely not a hedge, dispersion trading strategy is a fat-tail strategy which loses a lot of money during crisis periods...","The high difference between implied volatility of index options and subsequent realized volatility is a known fact. Trades routinely exploit this difference by selling options with consecutive delta hedging. There is however more elegant way to exploit this risk premium - the dispersion trading. The dispersion trading uses known fact that difference between implied and realized volatility is greater between index options than between individual stock option. Investor therefore could sell options on index and buy individual stocks options. Dispersion trading is a sort of correlation trading as trades are usually profitable in a time when the individual stocks are not strongly correlated and losses money during stress periods when correlation rises. Basic trade could be enhanced by buying options of firms with high belief disagreement (high analysts' disagreement about firms' earnings).","The investment universe consists of stocks from S&P 100 index.

Using an incomplete information economy, we develop a structural model with multiple assets where agents have heterogeneous beliefs about the growth of firms’ fundamentals and a business-cycle indicator and explain the different volatility risk premia of index and single-stock options. The wedge between the index and individual volatility risk premium is mainly driven by a correlation risk premium which emerges endogenously due to the following model features: In a full information economy with independent fundamentals, returns correlate solely due to the correlation of the individual stock with the aggregate endowment (“diversification effect”). In our economy, stock return correlation is endogenously driven by idiosyncratic and systemic (business-cycle) disagreement (“risk-sharing effect”). We show that this effect dominates the diversification effect, moreover it is independent of the number of firms and a firm’s share in the aggregate market. In equilibrium, the skewness of the individual stocks and the index differ due to a correlation risk premium. Depending on the share of the firm in the aggregate market, and the size of the disagreement about the business cycle, the skewness of the index can be larger (in absolute values) or smaller than the one of individual stocks. As a consequence, the volatility risk premium of the index is larger or smaller than the individual. In equilibrium, this different exposure to disagreement risk is compensated in the cross-section of options and model-implied trading strategies exploiting differences in disagreement earn substantial excess returns. We test the model predictions in a set of panel regressions, by merging three datasets of firm-specific information on analysts’ earning forecasts, options data on S&P 100 index options, options on all constituents, and stock returns. Sorting stocks based on differences in beliefs, we find that volatility trading strategies exploiting different exposures to disagreement risk in the cross-section of options earn high Sharpe ratios. The results are robust to different standard control variables and transaction costs and are not subsumed by other theories explaining the volatility risk premia."

This is one of the main features of the post-earnings announcement drift phenomenon and is typically attributed to investors’ underreaction to earnings news. I document that this autocorrelation has become significantly negative for firms with active exchange-traded options. For these easy-to-arbitrage firms, the firms in the highest decile of prior earnings announcement abnormal return (prior earnings surprise), on average, underperform the firms in the lowest decile by 1.29% (0.73%) at their next earnings announcement. Additional analyses are consistent with investors learning about post-earnings announcement drift and overcompensating. It seems that due to their well-documented history of apparently underreacting to earnings news, investors are now overreacting to earnings announcement news. This paper shows that attempts to exploit a popular trading strategy based on relative valuation can significantly reverse the previously documented pattern."

Given this information asymmetry, managers can make informed decisions about corporate actions such as equity offerings or repurchases. The announcement of stock repurchase or secondary equity offering is voluntary and can be easily moved by a few weeks or months. Therefore timing of SEO or repurchase announcement before earnings announcement could be perceived as important information about future performance of stock during earnings announcement period.","No - Selected strategy is designed as a long-only therefore it can't be used as a hedge against market drops as a lot of strategy's performance comes from equity market premium (as investor holds equities therefore his correlation to broad equity market is very very high).","Earnings announcement period is important time for many equity traders. It is time when most of the stocks move with a higher volatility which offers bigger potential for profit. We present interesting research paper which helps to increase odds of correctly pick outperforming (and underperforming) stocks during this period. Paper shows that timing of stock repurchase announcement and secondary equity offering (SEO) announcement is important predictor of performance during earnings announcement. Managers have ability to time stock repurchase and SEO announcement and research shows they choose to buyback stocks when they expect good earnings announcement and they prefer to execute SEO before bad earnings. Therefore investor could look for this indicators and build long only (with the help of information from stock repurchase announcements) of long-short (short leg with a help from SEO announcement date) trading portfolio with an attractive characteristics. We insert long-only description into our database (as it is easier to build and trade) but we recommend to review also long-short version of this strategy described in the source academic paper.","The investment univese consists of stocks from NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq (no ADRs, CEFs or REITs), bottom 25% of firms by market cap are dropped. Each quarter, investor looks for companies which announce stock repurchase program (with announced buyback for at least 5% of outstanding stocks) during days -30 to -15 before earnings announcement date for each company. Investor goes long stocks with announced buybacks during days -10 to +15 around earnings announcement.

Consistent with this conjecture, we find evidence of market timing and earnings predictability. The market reaction to earnings following repurchase announcements is statistically and economically significantly higher by 4.56% than earnings following SEO pricings over a 25 trading day window (-10, 15)."

In accordance with the information asymmetry and the heterogenous beliefs hypotheses,the persistence of momentum effect depends on size, idiosyncratic volatility, % of institutional ownership, and trading volume. According to the former, investors tend to be conservative in the case of stocks with higher idiosyncratic volatilities and lower percentage of outstanding stocks owned by institutional investors (they become consistent winners/losers due to slow price adjustment). The latter suggests that higher trading volume on stock (proxy for disagreement among investors) should produce stronger momentum effect.","Not known - Source and related research papers don't offer insight into correlation structure of proposed trading strategy to equity market risk, therefore we do not know if this strategy can be used as a hedge/diversification during time of market crisis. Strategy is built as a long-short, but it can be split into 2 parts. Long leg of strategy is surely strongly correlated to equity market however short-only leg can be maybe used as a hedge during bad times. Rigorous backtest is however needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.","The traditional momentum effect is one of the most well-known and best documented stock market anomalies. Also, some notable research about the persistency of momentum effect has already taken place at the portfolio level (for example Chen et al., 2014). However, recent research has taken the issue a bit further, focusing on the performance variation at the firm level rather than on more general portfolio level. Based on the ‚top decile long and bottom decile short‘ approach, the empirical evidence shows, inter alia, that only about 60% of the winner/loser stocks in the sample were consistent winners (losers) - in the top (bottom) decile both during the month of portfolio formation and in the following month - and that at least 1/4 of them even experienced a contrarian effect in the post-formation month. The authors of the recent academic research show that consistent winner stocks outperform inconsistent winner stocks, and conversely, consistent loser stocks underperform inconsistent loser stocks, in the post-formation period. With respect to this result, they suggested a strategy of buying consistent winners while selling consistent losers, which outperformed the traditional and 'inconsistent' momentum with 1.25% average monthly return (significantly positive even after adjusting for Fama-French‘s three factors and Carhart’s momentum factor, as opposed to the traditional and inconsistent momentum strategies with 1.06% and 0.47% average monthly returns, respectively).","The investment universe consists of stocks listed at NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, whose price data (at least for past 7 months) are available at CRSP database. The investor creates a zero-investment portfolio at the end of the month t, longing stocks that are in the top decile in terms of returns both in the period from t-7 to t-1 and from t-6 to t, while shorting stocks in the bottom decile in both periods (i.e. longing consistent winners and shorting consistent losers). The stocks in the portfolio are weighted equally. The holding period is six months, with no rebalancing during the period.  There is a one-month skip between formation and holding period.","Chen, Chou, Hsieh: Persistency of the Momentum Effect: The Role of Consistent Winners and Losershttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2652592Abstract:Momentum profits, resulting from buying winners and selling losers, are robust in the stock market; however, less than 60% of winner and loser stocks remain in winner and loser groups in the subsequent formation month. This study applies duration analysis to test the persistency of the momentum effect and demonstrates that consistent winners and losers experience higher subsequent momentum profits than inconsistent winners and losers. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis and the heterogeneous beliefs hypothesis, the momentum persistency is associated with size, idiosyncratic risk, institutional ownership, and trading volume. In addition, an asymmetric effect is observed—the post-formation return contributes to the winner persistency more, while the formation period return can explain the loser persistency more. The duration analysis also demonstrates that the trading volume reflects effects of both heterogeneous beliefs among investors and the momentum life cycle. The consistent momentum strategy may offer enhanced performance, despite controlling for factors associated withmarket risk, size, book-to-market ratio, momentum effect, and liquidity risk."

In this case, the most probable reason for the phenomenon, according to the authors, is the market makers‘ aversion to inventory risks that tend to increase dramatically in the pre-announcement period. Consequently, the market makers demand higher compensation for providing liquidity due to higher risk and therefore raise prices, which are expected to reverse after the earnings announcement.","Not known - Source and related research papers don't offer insight into correlation structure of proposed trading strategy to equity market risk, therefore we do not know if this strategy can be used as a hedge/diversification during time of market crisis.

Rigorous backtest is however needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.","Despite the fact that earnings announcements are anticipated events in most cases, multiple academic papers find the evidence that they still affect stock prices and therefore create a potentially profitable trading opportunities. For instance, one of the recent works shows that the short-term reversal is much stronger around the days of earnings announcement than in other, randomly chosen periods. More precisely, the LOW-HIGH (buying past losers and selling past winners) strategy yielded an average 3-day return (the window of t-1, t, and t+1, where t is the day of earnings announcement) of 1.45% during the 1996-2011 sample period, whereas the average return during random pseudo-announcement periods was only 0.22% (therefore more than a six-fold difference). The phenomenon, as suggested by the authors, is related to market makers‘ decisions regarding liquidity provision (see fundamental reason). The strategy further described is carried out on the subsample of big stocks due to better liquidity.","The investment universe consists of stocks listed at NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, whose daily price data are available at CRSP database. Earnings-announcement dates are collected from Compustat. Firstly, the investor sorts stocks into quintiles based on firm size. Then he further sorts the stocks in the top quintile (the biggest) into quintiles based on their average returns in the 3-day window between t-4 and t-2, where t is the day of earnings announcement. The investor goes long on the bottom quintile (past losers) and short on the top quintile (past winners) and holds the stocks during the 3-day window between t-1, t, and t+1. Stocks in the portfolios are weighted equally.","So, Wang: News-Driven Return Reversals: Liquidity Provision Ahead of Earnings Announcementshttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2275982Abstract:This study documents a six-fold increase in short-term return reversals during earnings announcements relative to non-announcement periods. Following prior research, we use reversals as a proxy for expected returns market makers demand for providing liquidity. Our findings highlight significant time-series variation in the magnitude of short-term return reversals and suggest that market makers demand higher expected returns prior to earnings announcements because of increased inventory risks that stem from holding net positions through the release of anticipated earnings news. Collectively, our findings suggest that uncertainty regarding anticipated information events elicits predictable increases in expected returns to liquidity provision and that these increases significantly affect the dynamics and information content of market prices."

Firstly, FSCORE is a comprehensive metric of a firm’s fundamental strength, because this score synthesizes information from nine signals along three dimensions of a firm’s financial performance (profitability, change in financial leverage and liquidity, and change in operational efficiency). Secondly, the fundamental information is gathered directly from the financial statements, which obviates the measurement error problem. And lastly, FSCORE is a nonparametric measure, comparing with a parametric approach, FSCORE is more robust and helps to reduce concerns over potential estimation biases. Moving into reasons for functionality of the proposed strategy, results support the hypothesis that short-term reversals are influenced by both noise trading and investor underreaction to fundamental information. Also results from regression analysis suggest that both noise trading and fundamental information significantly influence stock returns in the short horizon. No doubt, there is an conclusion that investor underreaction to fundamental information coupled with a noise trading can explain the observed empirical patterns in short-term reversals. Moreover, results indicate that the bid-ask spread cannot be the main source of the profitability for short-term reversals and the results are not particularly sensitive to alternative definitions of fundamental strength. Last but not least, simple short-term reversal and industry-adjusted reversal strategies fail to be profitable in the presence of transaction costs, however fundamental anchored reversal strategies are economically profitable even in the presence of transaction costs.","Yes - Equity reversal strategies are usually type of ""liquidity providing"" strategies and as such they usually perform well during market crises. However, reversal strategies are also naturally a ""short volatility"" strategies, their returns increase mainly in the weeks following large stock market market declines. Traders must be catious during crisis during days with a high volatility as reversal strategies usually force traders to buy stocks which performed especially bad (and to sell short stocks with an extremelly positive short term performance). This position is emotionally hard to open and risk management of reversal strategies must be also very strict during these days. We recommend reading research paper by Nagel: ""Evaporating Liquidity"" to gain insight into behaviour of reversal strategies during crises.","The short-term reversal in stock returns is already a well known and a well established anomaly that appears to contradict the weak-form market efficiency. Strategy based on this anomaly buys past winners and sells past losers. A possible and sensible explanation of the short-term reversal phenomenon is the overreaction of investors. Research in the past focused primarily on noise trading and ignored the important role of fundamental information. Curiously, new research suggests that there is a need to study the impact of fundamental news on short-term return reversals. Where a nonparametric metric of fundamental strength (FSCORE) is used to measure the impact from fundamental information. The need to measure the aforementioned impact is clear - there is an overwhelming evidence that investors underreact to fundamental news. Moreover, fundamental information metric has a persistent predictive effect on stock returns, what is consistent with the hypothesis of the slow diffusion of information and investor underreaction. Simply said, high FSCORE firms tend to earn much higher returns than low FSCORE firms. The paper has found significant evidence that recent losers with strong fundamental strength and recent winners with weak fundamental strength experience stronger reversals than other reversal portfolio strategies. A fundamental-anchore reversal strategy exploits this finding and this reversal strategy could generate a high significant average monthly returns that outperform the profit from the unconditional and traditional reversal strategy. The paper primarily studies all common stocks, however we present the data about large stocks since the small stocks bear their own unique features.","The investment universe consists of common stocks (share code 10 or 11) listed in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges. Stocks with prices less than $5 at the end of formation period are excluded. The range of FSCORE is from zero to nine points. Each signal is equal to one (zero) point if the signal indicates positive (negative) financial performance. A firm scores one point if it has realized a positive return-on-assets (ROA), a positive cash flow from operations, a positive change in ROA, a positive difference between net income from operations (Accrual), a decrease in the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, a positive change in the current ratio, no issuance of new common equity, a positive change in gross margin ratio and lastly a positive change in asset turnover ratio. Firstly, construct a quarterly FSCORE using the most recently available quarterly financial statement information. Monthly reversal data are matched each month with a most recently available quarterly FSCORE. Firm is classified as a fundamentally strong firm if the firm’s FSCORE is greater than or equal to seven (7-9), fundamentally middle firm (4-6) and fundamentally weak firm (0-3). Secondly, identify the large stocks subset - those in the top 40% of all sample stocks in term of market capitalization at the end of formation month t. After that, stocks are sorted on the past 1-month returns and firm’s most recently available quarterly FSCORE. Take a long position in past losers with favorable fundamentals (7-9) and simultaneously a short position in past winners with unfavorable fundamentals (0-3). Strategy is equally weighted and rebalanced monthly.","Zhu, Zhaobo and Sun, Licheng and Chen, Min: Noise Trading, Slow Diffusion of Information, and Short-Term Reversals: A Fundamental Analysis Approach https://ssrn.com/abstract=3097420Abstract: Contrary to the conventional wisdom that short-term return reversals are rooted in investors’ overreaction to fundamental news or driven by liquidity-based noninformational shocks alone, we find strong evidence that both noise trading and investor underreaction to fundamental information contribute to the reversal. With help from a comprehensive and nonparametric measure of firms’ fundamental strength, we document that an enhanced short-term reversal strategy that buys past losers with strong fundamentals and sells past winners with weak fundamentals significantly outperforms the unconditional reversal strategy. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of theoretical models where investors underreact to slowly diffusing fundamental information."

Employees get paid at the end of the month and many of them either automatically invest a portion of their paycheck in the market through retirement contribution or are encouraged to do so by having a surplus of funds with the new paycheck. However, many companies pay their employees twice a month, on the 15th and at the end of the month, therefore building on that the pay-day effect holds true for the turn-of-the-month days, there should be a clear pattern in the middle of the month as well as at the end of the month. Since employees do make retirement contributions with every paycheck. Results confirm that abnormal returns indeed exist in the middle of the month. According to the research, the 16th of the month is not only the 3rd best day in the month overall, but has moved up in the ranks monotonically every decade since the 1950s, until the most recent decade, the 2010s. Although more and more firms are paying wages on a bi-weekly basis, the highest average hourly earnings are distributed semi-monthly followed by monthly distribution, what favors this strategy and therefore this effect should not diminish. Another possible reason for the functionality is that, because the other pay days have been extensively discussed in the literature, practitioners have been trying to take advantage of the anomaly and market efficiency has caught up, reducing the magnitude of the anomaly. Therefore, this novel anomaly has a strong perfomance if we compare it with the other days and mainly, it is not traded-off, at least not yet.","No - Strategy is timing equity market but invests long-only into equity market factor (even that only for a short period of time) therefore is not suitable as a hedge/diversification during market/economic crises.","The turn-of-the-month anomaly is a well-known term in the financial world and has important implications for academics as well as for practitioners. For academics, the effect contradicts one of the founding principles of modern finance - that the market is at weak-form efficient. On the other hand, it also presents a tradable pattern that investors can potentially take advantage of. Some research has linked the abnormal return to pay-day effect. However, many companies pay their employees twice a month, on the 15th day and at the end of the month, therefore it is natural that on the condition that the pay-day effect holds true for the turn-of-the-month days, there should be a recognizable pattern in the middle of the month as well. This paper confirms the aforementioned hypothesis, since the results confirm that abnormal returns indeed exist in the middle of the month (the 16th day in the month is the 3rd best day in the month - if we are comparing the returns). The semi-monthly paychecks are distributed on the 15th of each month and the retirement contribution portion should reach the financial institution at the end of the day, being ready for investing into the market on the following day, the 16th. Assuming that a significant portion of the retirement contribution funds are invested in broad-market funds, such as the S&P500 fund, strategy trades the S&P500 índex. Last but not least, the strategy that utilizes this pattern is really simple and the only data that are needed are publicly available. Everything consists of simply holding the S&P500 index on 16th day of the month.","The investment universe consists of S&P500 index. Simply, buy and hold the index during the 16th day in the month during each month of the year.","Ma, Aixin and Pratt, William Robert: Payday Anomalyhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3257064 Abstract: Abnormal returns have been found on days near the turn of the calendar months. Previous studies have linked the phenomenon to month-end paychecks, of which a sizable proportion goes into employees’ retirement accounts and is then automatically invested in the market. Since many institutions adopt a semi-monthly pay schedule, we test the hypothesis that the market should exhibit detectable mid-month abnormal movement. Our results indicate that the 16th day of the month statistically and economically outperforms all other calendar days except the 1st and 2nd. As more and more institutions transition into bi-weekly pay schedule, however, the mid-month payday anomaly becomes less prominent."
