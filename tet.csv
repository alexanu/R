"5"," Technical Analysis is based on the belief that technical indicators give insight into the 
current and future market situation. A technical indicator is a 
function that retrieves information from a time series 
of prices or other data, and converts them to an output that can be used as a
trade signal for buying or selling at the right moment. For instance, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator 
with a Time Period 100 adds the last 100 prices and divides the sum by 
100, this way calculating the average price of the last 100 bars. If the current price rises above the average, some traders believe that  prices will further rise, and take this as a buy signal. It the  price falls below the average, they believe that   prices will further fall and they must sell.","en/ta.htm"
"6","Indicators usually generate buy or sell signals when they reach a threshold, cross each other, 
or cross the price curve. About 800 different indicators are meanwhile published in books and trading magazines. 
The most often used are available in Zorro's indicator function library listed 
below. The library contains moving averages, oscillators, bands, momentum, strength indices,   linear regression, signal processing, and exotic indicators, 
and is divided in several sections:","en/ta.htm"
"7","Aside from the indicators and data series functions, price curves and portfolio performance can also be analyzed with other methods:","en/ta.htm"
"8","Traditional indicators are mostly based on the TA-Lib indicator library by Mario Fortier (www.ta-lib.org) that has established  as a standard. The usage,  algorithms, and  source codes of  TA-Lib indicators can be found online at www.tadoc.org; the source codes are also included in the Zorro/Source folder. The source code of most other indicators and analysis functions can be found in  
indicators.c. ","en/ta.htm"
"9","If you need an indicator that is is missing, simply add it. Most technical indicators are primitive and can be implemented in a few minutes with  a   few lines of code. The file indicators.c contains the   source codes of many nonstandard indicators, so you can use it as learning   material for adding more complex indicators. ","en/ta.htm"
