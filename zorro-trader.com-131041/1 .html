              <p> <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                </strong>Welcome to the Zorro project! The idea behind this software is simple: Let some wily machine redistribute money from the rich to the poor. </p>
              <p> Zorro is a software tool for financial analysis, machine 
			  learning, and algorithmic 
			  trading. It is not a 'robot' and not a trading platform, but has 
			  some elements of them. Technically it's a rapid development 
			  system that can be used to train neural networks, optimize parameters, test 
			  strategies with several methods, and trade them automated with online brokers.</p>
			<p> Zorro was designed to beat the world financial system by tapping into 
			its money flows. In order to find the right moment to buy and sell, Zorro uses algorithms that detect anomalies in price curves, such as the beginning of a 
			pattern, trend, or cycle. Such anomalies allow short-term price prediction under certain conditions. Once set up, Zorro trades fully autonomous and can operate without human interaction. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
              Zorro is a community project. It's free because we believe that a huge number of people should 
			understand the financial markets and participate in their profits. Here's why:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Technical progress has enormously boosted productivity worldwide and is still increasing it at a rate of about 2% per year. Theoretically, we needed to work four days less every year for producing the same goods and earning the same income. <br>
&nbsp; </li>
                <li>However it does not happen this way. Producers use productivity boosts for reducing costs - mostly wages and salaries. This is supposed to improve their profits, but it also has an adverse affect. Layoffs, unemployment, subsequent demand shortfall and economic crises eat a large part of the benefits from increased productivity.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The remaining excess profits are invested - however not in production of goods, but in financial assets. Hedge funds, investment banks, and trading firms circulate an immense money volume (up to seven trillion US$ per day) through the financial markets, this way creating a shadow economy that largely surpasses the market of real products and services. It consumes most rewards of technical progress, and gives back occasional market crashes and financial crises.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
                <li>But it also offers the opportunity to redistribute some of the excess profit back from the rich to the poor. Providing many people with a small but regular trading income will take liquidity out of the financial markets and inject it back into the production cycle. This will boost demand worldwide and soften the world's economical problems.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Zorro comes with several built-in  trade strategies that are intended for generating a regular income. However its main purpose is helping people to 
			  understand, analyze, experiment with, and exploit the financial 
			  markets. For this it contains an algorithmic trading course and a serious strategy development system (learn more <a href="features.php"><strong>here</strong></a>). All this is free. 
			  In return, go through the courses, learn algorithmic trading, and develop 
			  your own trading strategies. Share them with others, and attack the financial markets with  many different ideas and methods. </p>
